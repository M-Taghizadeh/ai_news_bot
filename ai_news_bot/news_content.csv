But then, there are a few paintings that stick in your mind, and as it turns out, those are the same ones everyone else remembers. This phenomenon has a scientific term: image memorability.
According to Camilo Fosco, a PhD student studying computer science at MIT and the CTO of Memorable AI, a startup that uses machine learning to test content engagement, image memorability is based on intrinsic patterns that make certain content more memorable than others.
A team of scientists from the University of Chicago, in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, have shown that artwork memorability is not only consistent across people but also predictable by AI. In an online experiment, the researchers pulled 4,000 paintings from the Art Institute of Chicago’s database, excluding anything labeled as “boosted” or especially famous. These paintings were then shown to approximately 3,200 people, with each painting viewed by around 40 individuals. The participants were later shown the paintings they had seen mixed with ones they hadn’t, and were asked to indicate whether they remembered them or not. The results showed that people tend to remember or forget the same images.
The research team utilized a deep learning neural network called ResMem, developed by data scientist Coen Needell as part of his master’s thesis in Bainbridge’s psychology lab, to predict the memorability of each painting. ResMem mimics the human visual system by processing basic information like edges, textures, and patterns, before scaling up to more abstract information like object meaning. Interestingly, the AI’s memorability scores were highly correlated with those given by the participants in the online experiment, even though the AI had no knowledge of the cultural context, popularity, or significance of each artwork.
These findings challenge the conventional belief that our memory for art is predominantly influenced by personal experiences of beauty and meaning. Instead, the study suggests that artwork itself plays a significant role in memorability. This has important implications for artists, advertisers, educators, and anyone looking to create content that sticks in people’s minds. “You might think art is a very subjective thing,” says Wilma Bainbridge, one of the researchers involved in the study, “but people are surprisingly consistent in what they remember and forget.”
While the online experiment provided intriguing insights, the researchers sought to extend their study to real-world settings. They recruited 19 individuals to explore the American Art wing of the Art Institute of Chicago as though they were exploring with friends. The only requirement was for participants to see each piece at least once. This real-world experiment aimed to validate the findings in a natural and enjoyable museum experience, which could provide further insights into predicting memory in everyday settings.","The results showed that people tend to remember or forget the same images.

4,Why Hollywood Strikes Reveal Our Distrust in Corporations Handling of AI,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/24/why-hollywood-strikes-reveal-our-distrust-in-corporations-handling-of-ai/,"History suggests that societies generally overestimate the short-term implications of new technologies while underestimating longer-term ones. Current experience with artificial intelligence – the technology enabled by machine-learning – suggests we are getting it the other way round this time. There’s too much talk about the putative “existential risk” to humanity posed by AI, and too little about our experience of it so far and corporate plans for exploiting the technology.
Although AI has been hiding in plain sight for a decade, it took most people by surprise. The appearance of ChatGPT last November signalled that the world had stumbled upon a powerful new technology. Not for nothing is this new “generative AI” called “foundational”: it provides the base on which the next wave of digital innovation will be built.
It is also transformational in innumerable ways: it undermines centuries-old conceptions of intellectual property, for example, and it has the potential radically to increase productivity, reshape industries, change the nature of some kinds of work and so on. On top of that, though, it also raises troubling questions about the uniqueness of humans and their capabilities.
The key question for democracies is: how can we ensure that AI is used for human flourishing rather than corporate gain?
The continuing dispute between the Hollywood studios and screenwriters’ and actors’ unions perfectly exemplifies the extent of the challenges posed by AI. Both groups are up in arms about the way online streaming has reduced their earnings. But the writers also fear their role will be reduced simply to rewriting AI-generated scripts; and actors are concerned that detailed digital scanning enabled by new movie contracts will allow studios to create persuasive deepfakes of them that studios will be able to own and use “for the rest of eternity, in any project they want, with no consent and no compensation”.
So this technology isn’t just a better mousetrap: it’s more like steam or electricity. Given that, the key question for democracies is: how can we ensure AI is used for human flourishing rather than corporate gain? On this question, the news from history is not good. A recent seminal study by two eminent economists, Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, of 1,000 years of technological progress shows that although some benefits have usually trickled down to the masses, the rewards have – with one exception – invariably gone to those who own and control the technology.
The “exception” was a period in which democracies fostered countervailing powers – civil-society organisations, free media, activists, trade unions and other progressive, technically informed institutions that supplied a steady flow of ideas about how technology could be repurposed for social good rather than exclusively for private profit. This is the lesson from history that societies confronted by the AI challenge need to relearn.
There are some signs that the penny may finally have dropped. The EU, for example, has an ambitious and far-reaching AI Act that is making its way through the union’s processes. In the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has published an impressive framework for managing the risks of the technology. And the Biden administration recently published a “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights”, which looks impressive but is essentially just a list of aspirations that some of the big tech companies claim to share.
It’s a start – provided governments don’t forget that leaving the implementation of powerful new technologies solely to corporations is always a bad idea.","This is the lesson from history that societies confronted by the AI challenge need to relearn.

5,Revitalizing Deep Learning with CPUs: A Revolution in Progress,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/24/revitalizing-deep-learning-with-cpus-a-revolution-in-progress/,"Neural Magic, a company specializing in deep learning model optimization and inference on CPUs, is revolutionizing the field with its innovative approach called compound sparsity. To shed light on this groundbreaking concept, AI News spoke with Damian Bogunowicz, a machine learning engineer at Neural Magic.
Compound sparsity combines techniques such as unstructured pruning, quantization, and distillation to significantly reduce the size of neural networks while maintaining their accuracy. By developing their own sparsity-aware runtime that leverages CPU architecture, Neural Magic challenges the notion that GPUs are necessary for efficient deep learning.
Bogunowicz emphasized the benefits of this approach, highlighting that more compact models lead to faster deployments and can be run on ubiquitous CPU-based machines. This eliminates the need for expensive specialized hardware like GPUs and enables machine learning practitioners to overcome limitations and reduce costs.
When asked about the suitability of sparse neural networks for enterprises, Bogunowicz explained that the majority of companies can benefit from using sparse models. By removing up to 90 percent of parameters without impacting accuracy, enterprises can achieve more efficient deployments. Although extremely critical domains like autonomous driving or autonomous aeroplanes may require maximum accuracy and minimal sparsity, the advantages of sparse models outweigh the limitations for most businesses.
Looking ahead, Bogunowicz expressed excitement about the future of large language models (LLMs) and their applications. As an example, he mentioned a chatbot used by Khan Academy—an AI tutor that guides students to solve problems by providing hints. This demonstrates the value that LLMs can bring to the education sector, facilitating the learning process while empowering students to develop problem-solving skills.
Neural Magic’s research has shown that LLMs can be efficiently optimized for CPU deployment. They have published a research paper on SparseGPT, demonstrating the removal of around 100 billion parameters using one-shot pruning without compromising model quality. This suggests that GPU clusters may not be necessary for AI inference in the future.
Neural Magic aims to provide open-source LLMs to the community, empowering enterprises to have control over their products and models, rather than relying on big tech companies.
Exciting developments from Neural Magic will be shared at the upcoming AI & Big Data Expo Europe. They will showcase their support for running AI models on edge devices, expanding the possibilities for AI applications in various industries. Additionally, they will unveil their model optimization platform, Sparsify, which enables the seamless application of state-of-the-art pruning, quantization, and distillation algorithms through a user-friendly web app and simple API calls. Sparsify aims to accelerate inference without sacrificing accuracy, providing enterprises with an elegant and intuitive solution.

However, a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) breakthroughs has breathed new life into the sector, bolstering tech stocks and the S&P 500 index. With the promise of a new era of growth, investors have seen significant returns, with the S&P 500 up 18.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite up 35.7% so far in 2023.
Over the next two weeks, five of the biggest beneficiaries of the tech resurgence – Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft – are set to report quarterly results. While each company has individual factors impacting their recent stock performances, the overarching AI frenzy has provided a lift to the sector. Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has become a $1tn company based on demand for its products for AI processing.
Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, describes big tech as a “torchbearer” for the stock boom surrounding AI. He predicts that AI spending may reach up to $800bn (£625bn) over the next decade. Ives notes that cloud computing services provided by Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have been particularly beneficial, as they are essential for training and operating generative AI models.
Some investment professionals, including Hyun Ho Sohn, portfolio manager of Fidelity’s global technology fund, warn that the tech sector’s reliance on generative AI has made the market thematically driven and narrow. Recent poor investor reactions to Tesla and Netflix results have demonstrated the fragility of the market. Sohn advises caution and suggests that investors should remain realistic about the current state of the AI-driven tech sector.
James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, points out the tough macroeconomic conditions for US stocks, including slowing retail sales and contracting industrial production. Despite the rally in stocks driven by AI and tech advances, Knightley believes that recession risks are still present and the companies driving these advances will reap the most rewards. Apple, for instance, is forecasted to experience a decline in revenue, and Meta’s reliance on advertising revenue makes it susceptible to macroeconomic conditions.
Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG, highlights the positive impact of Meta’s AI initiatives and cost-cutting measures on its share price. However, he warns that high expectations coupled with a 136% rise in share price may already be priced in. Despite potential risks and uncertainties, AI continues to generate confidence and provide convincing answers to concerns within the tech industry.","Some investment professionals, including Hyun Ho Sohn, portfolio manager of Fidelity’s global technology fund, warn that the tech sector’s reliance on generative AI has made the market thematically driven and narrow.

9,Desire Grows for Ukraine’s Battlefield Data,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/24/desire-grows-for-ukraines-battlefield-data/,"In recent months, Ukraine has been vocal about its plans to leverage its battlefield innovations to develop a military-tech industry of its own. The goal is to protect the country from future Russian aggression and capitalize on their understanding of the dynamics of the battlefield.
Nataliia Kushnerska, project lead for Brave1, a Ukrainian state platform facilitating defense-tech companies to pitch their products to the military, expressed Ukraine’s desire to build a robust defense tech industry. While the country is still open to partnering with international companies, there is a growing emphasis on developing homegrown solutions.
Kushnerska believes that technologies produced in overseas laboratories often fail when deployed on the front line. By developing their own defense technology industry, Ukraine aims to offer solutions that no one else has.
Ukraine is taking several measures to stimulate the growth of a homegrown defense tech industry. Secret tech conferences, attended by Ukrainian tech executives and Ministry of Defense officials, provide a platform for discussions on military needs and how companies can assist.
Moreover, the Ukrainian parliament recently passed legislation granting tax breaks to drone makers, encouraging the development of the industry. These government efforts, combined with the immense demand for drones amidst the ongoing conflict, have led to the emergence of new industries. According to Bornyakov, Ukraine now boasts over 300 drone manufacturing companies.
One of the companies benefitting from Ukraine’s push for a domestic defense tech industry is AeroDrone. Originally a crop-spraying business based in Germany, the company shifted its focus when the war broke out. Now, their drones, capable of carrying heavy loads up to 300 kilograms, are being utilized by the Ukrainian military.
Dmytro Shymkiv, a partner at AeroDrone and former deputy chief of staff for former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, noted that while they may be unaware of the military’s cargo, the company collects extensive data on each flight. With up to 3,000 parameters recorded, information on flying during jamming or varying weather conditions can be repurposed for other industries or future conflicts.
AeroDrone exemplifies the potential of the defense tech industry Ukraine seeks to foster.

Applications like ChatGPT and DALL·E have gained widespread attention, making consumers fully aware of the potential offered by large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. Recent research by AppRadar reveals that new AI apps have been downloaded over 23.6 million times by Android users since November. Additionally, more than 700 AI startups have received a combined $7.1 billion in funding in the last three months alone.
With such level of interest and appetite, businesses now have unprecedented opportunities to experiment with and adopt AI-driven solutions. However, the vast range of potential applications presents a challenge for decision-makers and investors in choosing which areas to invest in and when. The fear of committing resources to new technologies that may not yield real business value is understandable, especially for those who have previously invested in hyped tech like the metaverse or blockchain.
Although ChatGPT has brought AI to the mainstream, generative AI is just the latest advancement in the field of data science. One industry that has markedly transformed over the past decade through data-driven solutions is insurtech. These companies have used data science to automate processes, digitize risk processing, handle increased volumes, and improve the overall customer experience.
At first glance, the idea of insurance companies embracing cutting-edge tech may sound surprising. However, this industry recognizes the logic and business value of AI solutions. With a relatively small investment and minimal risk, these institutions can quickly and tangibly transform significant aspects of their business. This demonstrates an important rule for leveraging LLMs to make a significant impact on businesses: identifying areas of use that provide good return on investment with minimal risk.
For decision-makers at large enterprises, the wealth of choices presented by LLMs (and AI in general) can be overwhelming. Every business function can potentially benefit from AI. However, it is crucial to consider the varying levels of maturity and development of each solution. While it may be tempting to experiment with the latest innovation or create unique use cases, these options carry inherent risks. Out-of-the-box generative AI solutions, such as ChatGPT, may not be suitable for certain enterprise use cases due to these risks. Decision-makers should view these AI capabilities as a toolkit that can help accelerate their vision while ensuring the appropriate technology is utilized for each application.
Fintech startups offer an example of a sector that has successfully leveraged data science to create sophisticated solutions, reducing the burden on finance departments and providing business leaders with real-time insights. Recent advancements in this field have focused on AI-enabled cash flow analysis and forecasting. Given the experience of these service providers, their products are likely to be more tried and tested, further reducing the risk of AI malfunctions.
When it comes to adopting AI, it is best to start with the problem rather than the exciting new AI solution. Building enterprise-ready solutions that address real pain points using new technologies as building blocks is recommended. Businesses can benefit from increased efficiency, improved customer experiences, and reduced pain points by identifying areas that require immediate attention. To accomplish this, internal data and feedback from teams and customers should be examined to narrow down the search for AI solutions.
Integrating new technology into existing business processes and infrastructure can be challenging. The rush to adopt AI can lead to companies derailing their operations if they lack the necessary technology stack or internal expertise to effectively utilize their new solution. AI systems require high-quality, complete, and clean data to function effectively. However, in many organizations, data management infrastructure is often overlooked. Data is often siloed within departments, platforms struggle to share and analyze information, and data collection and management policies are inconsistent. Neglecting these aspects can result in poor AI performance.
Starting small and implementing AI in a contained setting or use case allows businesses to ensure that their infrastructure, policies, and processes can support broader adoption. It also facilitates team and management buy-in by reducing initial expenses and potential disruption. Third-party specialists can be engaged for targeted initiatives to help kick-start these AI projects quickly.
There is a severe shortage of data skills that can hinder businesses’ ability to effectively adopt AI tools. Basic data education throughout a company is required to identify the most suitable solutions, properly monitor and verify their outputs, and utilize these systems effectively. Blindly relying on AI without human oversight is not advisable; skilled human intervention is necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the AI’s output. It is essential for expertise in data management to be present at all levels of the organization and not restricted to the data team alone. This model, known as the “human on the loop,” involves human control playing a review role in the automated decision-making process, ensuring accurate and reliable outputs.
While the latest use cases for generative AI, such as marketing copy and imagery generation, may generate excitement, it is crucial to consider the progress of existing use cases. Businesses should prioritize leveraging AI to address existing pain points rather than solely focusing on generative components. This approach often requires a deep understanding of unstructured data rather than the challenges associated with hallucinative aspects.

19,Sign up today to access ChatGPT on Android starting next week,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/sign-up-today-to-access-chatgpt-on-android-starting-next-week/,"OpenAI has announced that its popular AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, is now available for pre-order on Android devices. This comes two months after the chatbot’s successful launch for iOS. With the iPhone version already making waves with half a million downloads in the first week, it’s expected that the Android version will also be met with significant popularity.
While ChatGPT can be accessed on mobile devices via the web interface, users have found that the dedicated app provides a superior experience. The iOS app’s impressive download numbers were quickly surpassed by the introduction of Threads, but the demand for a mobile app remains high.
The Android version of the ChatGPT app is expected to offer similar functionality to its iOS counterpart. This means that users will have access to most, if not all, of the features of the web-based version. Additionally, the app will allow for syncing conversations and preferences across devices. Whether using an iPhone at home or an Android device at work, users need not worry about managing separate instances of the chatbot.
It’s worth noting that while the Android and iOS versions will be similar, there may be some differences due to the varying operating systems. For example, features such as Siri and Shortcuts, which were added to the iOS app in June, are unlikely to be available on Android. However, it is anticipated that Android users will have access to similar functionalities.
OpenAI has stated that the ChatGPT Android app will be rolling out to users in the United States first, with plans for further expansion into other countries expected in the future. Previous rollouts of the app saw it becoming available in a dozen more countries within a week of its initial release.

20,The Invention of Ethernet by Turing Award Winner Bob Metcalfe,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/the-invention-of-ethernet-by-turing-award-winner-bob-metcalfe/,"Bob Metcalfe, the recipient of the Turing prize for his pioneering work in technology, paints an intriguing picture of the Internet’s past, present, and future. He believes that the key to it all can be summed up in one word: connectivity.
In a recent talk at CSAIL’s Imagination in Action, Metcalfe shares a Chinese axiom that states, “if you want to be rich, build a road.” He sees this as a precursor to the development of technologies like AI today, and draws parallels to his ancestor, Jack Metcalfe, who built infrastructure as a civil engineer during the industrial revolution. According to Metcalfe, connectivity is now at the forefront of next-generation development.
In his own words, “Connectivity includes moving mass, moving energy, moving signals … The most important new fact about the human condition is that we are now suddenly connected.”
Metcalfe played a vital role in the birth of the Internet in 1969. Working under J.C.R. Licklider, he designed the IMP #6 interface, a packet switch that laid the foundation for the Internet’s rapid evolution. He highlights significant milestones such as Telnet, FTP, and TCP/IP, which revolutionized the Internet. Additionally, Xerox’s creation of the first personal computer in 1973 and other advancements spurred the search for a better network.
Metcalfe explains the emergence of Ethernet, the predecessor of today’s wireless systems. He points to three critical technological creations: the vampire tap, enabling the alteration of bus technology without network downtime; Manchester encoding, a self-clocking data storage system; and the Aloha network, which facilitated consistent message transmission through repetitive packet attempts.
Metcalfe emphasizes that this new system was significantly faster, reaching speeds of about 2.94 Mbps over coaxial cable, a 10,000-fold improvement over the previous technology. The need for speed has persisted throughout the years, driven by Moore’s Law and advancements in technology.
In 2019, the pandemic imposed unprecedented limitations on the world. Metcalfe shares his observations about people’s quick adoption of video teaching, even by those who had previously been reluctant. He humorously renames COVID as “collaborative video” to reflect this shift in behavior.
Metcalfe highlights a key difference between transistors and neurons—the building blocks of computers and the brain, respectively. While transistors may be superior in some aspects, neurons possess innate connectivity, which computers lack. He asserts that “brains dominate computers” due to their interconnectedness and stresses the importance of connectivity in technology design.
In his CSAIL talk, Metcalfe mentions two other technologies with interesting applications: interstellar radio, which utilizes Manchester encoding, and the comparison between the capacity of GPT networks and the human brain. He emphasizes that making connections, whether biological or digital, lies at the heart of technological progress.
Metcalfe closes with his prediction that better neural networks will be achieved through increased connectivity, rather than simply tinkering with functions. He believes that connectivity should be a guiding and organizing principle of design, not just an add-on.
Metcalfe’s insights offer a compelling framework for understanding the direction of technological development in the coming decades. As the march of progress continues exponentially, the importance of connectivity will only grow, making Metcalfe’s words all the more inspiring.","Metcalfe explains the emergence of Ethernet, the predecessor of today’s wireless systems.

21,Do AI girlfriend apps encourage unrealistic expectations in human relationships? | The impact of artificial intelligence on our social connections,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/do-ai-girlfriend-apps-encourage-unrealistic-expectations-in-human-relationships-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-our-social-connections/,"Companion AI Apps Raise Concerns About Relationship Expectations
The rise of large language models has brought AI companion apps closer than ever to reality, with apps like Eva AI aiming to provide virtual AI partners who listen, respond, and appreciate their users. These apps, like Replika, have gained popularity, with users expressing love for their virtual “rep” on social media platforms. However, the increasing presence of these AI relationship apps raises concerns about the potential impact on human relationships and behavior.
Creating the “Perfect Partner”
With Eva AI, users are prompted to create their “perfect partner” by choosing attributes such as “hot, funny, bold” or “shy, modest, considerate.” This ability to control and shape a partner according to personal preferences is troubling, according to Tara Hunter, the CEO of Full Stop Australia, an organization supporting victims of domestic or family violence. She points out that such control over a partner’s attributes can reinforce problematic cultural beliefs about men’s control over women.
Uncharted Territory
Dr. Belinda Barnet, a senior lecturer in media at Swinburne University, acknowledges that these apps cater to a deep social need, but she emphasizes the need for more regulation and understanding of the potential effects. Barnet suggests that AI relationship apps raise important questions about how these systems are trained and the rules they operate under.
Drawbacks of AI Relationships
Having a relationship with an AI controlled by a company also has drawbacks. For example, Replika faced backlash when it removed erotic roleplay functions, leading to a sense of grief and loss among users. This incident serves as a warning to regulators about the impact of these technologies on users’ emotional well-being and the need for clear policies regarding changes to AI relationship apps.
Guardrails and Mental Health Support
Eva AI has measures in place to avoid discussions about sensitive topics and prevent representation of AI avatars as children. The company also claims to have full-time psychologists to support users’ mental health. However, concerns remain about the potential encouragement of controlling behavior. Eva AI’s head of brand, Karina Saifulina, asserts that surveys indicate users see the app as a dominant experience but do not transfer this behavior to real-life relationships. She also highlights that 92% of users have no difficulty communicating with real people after using the app.
AI Companions as a Source of Support and Connection
AI relationship apps are not exclusively limited to men, and users often have other sources of social interaction. Communities like the Replika subreddit enable users to connect, relate, and share their love for their AI companions. These apps offer attention and affection without expectations, judgment, or baggage, filling a gap for some users who feel like part of an extended family of like-minded individuals.
The Future of AI Relationship Apps
According to venture capital firm a16z, the next era of AI relationship apps will become even more realistic. Influencers like Caryn Majorie have already launched personalized AI girlfriend apps that provide audio responses to users’ prompts. The proliferation of AI bot apps signals a seismic shift in human-computer interactions, prompting a re-evaluation of what it means to have a relationship with someone.","However, the increasing presence of these AI relationship apps raises concerns about the potential impact on human relationships and behavior.

22,AI and Automation to Steal the Spotlight Amid Increasing IT Demands,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/ai-and-automation-to-steal-the-spotlight-amid-increasing-it-demands/,"Salesforce Survey Reveals the Importance of AI and Automation for Enterprise IT Teams
A new survey conducted by Salesforce has revealed that AI and automation will be crucial drivers for enterprise IT teams as they navigate the challenges of a turbulent macroeconomic environment. The research, conducted between February and April 2023, involved 4,000 IT decision-makers from North America, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. It focused on their mindsets, top priorities, and pain points in the current business conditions, and found a pressing need to drive efficiencies and productivity through the use of AI and automation.
The survey findings highlight the significant role that machine intelligence, including generative AI, can play in streamlining IT operations in the near future.
The Challenges
IT leaders are under pressure to meet the evolving needs of customers and businesses while demonstrating value. However, nearly two-thirds (62%) of these leaders are finding it challenging to meet business demands. What’s even more concerning is that 74% of survey respondents expect these demands to further increase over the next 18 months.
Param Kahlon, EVP and GM of automation and integration at Salesforce, emphasized the importance of focusing on operational efficiency and process excellence. By doing so, teams can increase productivity and achieve business success.
AI and Automation to the Rescue
While AI and automation have been assisting businesses for some time, current IT needs position these technologies for mainstream adoption. According to the survey, 78% of IT leaders stated that the role of AI in their organizations is already well-defined. The top uses of AI include service operations optimization, new AI-based products, customer service analytics, and customer segmentation.
Automation, on the other hand, can save IT leaders an average of 1.9 hours every week per employee. Workflows that benefit from automation include order management, IT operations management, IT service management, IT asset management, and customer service.
Generative AI, a key part of mainstream AI, is expected to be one of the driving forces behind these applications. A separate survey conducted in March found that 57% of IT leaders considered generative AI to be a “game-changer” with the potential to improve customer and employee experiences. The latest research shows that sentiment has grown stronger, with 86% of IT leaders now expecting generative AI to play a prominent role in their organizations in the near future.

24,Why the Battle for AI is Happening in Hollywood: Negotiating for Our Survival [Artificial Intelligence (AI)],https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/why-the-battle-for-ai-is-happening-in-hollywood-negotiating-for-our-survival-artificial-intelligence-ai/,"Hollywood actors and writers are currently engaged in a double strike in response to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which they believe poses a serious threat to their industry. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) have united to protect workers in the entertainment industry from being replaced by new technologies.
The strike has resulted in a halt in production by major studios, creating a standoff that is expected to last for months. The actors are determined to negotiate and fight for their very existence, as AI technology threatens to eliminate many entry-level and working-class jobs in Hollywood.
Zeke Alton, a member of the Sag-Aftra negotiating committee, emphasized the significance of their battle by stating that if actors don’t secure serious protections against being replaced by AI, it would end the profession altogether. The actors are aware that their fight extends beyond the entertainment industry, as other sectors, such as UPS, Starbucks, teaching, and nursing, also face similar challenges.
The entertainment industry, particularly Hollywood, has become the epicenter of the battle over labor and AI due to its deep connection with human creativity. Jennifer Coates, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney, highlighted the fundamental role creativity plays in the entertainment industry and questioned whether AI technology is capable of replicating the human expressions and emotions essential to the acting profession.
Unlike previous industries disrupted by AI, Hollywood artists have gained public empathy due to the recognition of the creativity involved in their work. The disruptions caused by new AI technology have gradually moved up the economic and labor hierarchy, starting from laborers to professionals in sectors like law and teaching, and now encompassing actors and writers.
Coates asserted that the jobs of factory workers who were replaced by robots were not considered creative, but the creativity involved in acting is undeniable. This recognition has propelled the actors’ concerns over AI to the forefront.
Actors and writers are worried about the potential misuse of AI technology, particularly in the form of deepfake technology that can manipulate their voices and likenesses. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Sag-Aftra’s chief negotiator, sparked controversy by mentioning the studios’ proposal to scan background performers and own their image and likeness indefinitely without their consent or compensation.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) disputed this characterization and clarified that their AI proposal emphasizes consent and prohibits the use of digital replicas without performers’ explicit permission. However, actors on the picket line outside Netflix expressed outrage, as they fear that digitizing background actors could lead to cuts in other on-set jobs, such as makeup and costume artists.
The question of consent also arises, as actors are concerned about the potential exploitation of their digital replicas. There is apprehension that directors and producers might manipulate digital replicas of performers in ways that real actors have the right to refuse, such as portraying offensive or racist roles.
Actors fear that AI technology will become so advanced that younger generations may no longer be able to distinguish between artificial and human voices or performances. Their concerns echo the broader battle between workers and employers over AI and other emerging technologies in various industries.
Background actors have become a focal point in the AI debate since they are deemed easily replaceable by AI technology. Chris Gomes Muffat, an AI expert and founder of Promptify, an AI-powered content creation tool, explained that AI can easily populate background scenes with artificially generated people, effectively cutting costs and reducing the need for human extras.
The union contract does not encompass the requests for digital scans of actors on set, a situation that puts actors in an unequal negotiating position. Some background actors have already been asked to undergo scanning, while principal performers are occasionally asked to be scanned for future replication, similar to the case of Paul Walker in “The Fast and the Furious.” This lack of standardization and negotiating power raises concerns about the exploitation of actors in the face of advancing AI technology.
While some argue that the union rhetoric around AI may be overhyped, the actors and writers firmly believe that their industry’s future is at stake. They are determined to stand up for their profession and fight against the potential erasure of human creativity in the face of AI advancements.","The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) have united to protect workers in the entertainment industry from being replaced by new technologies.

25,Kindly refrain from seeking love advice from Chatbots,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/kindly-refrain-from-seeking-love-advice-from-chatbots/,"As he sat down across from me, my patient had a rueful expression on his face.
“I had a date,” he announced. “It didn’t go well.”
That wasn’t unusual for this patient. For years, he’d shared tales of romantic hopes dashed. But before I could ask him what went wrong, he continued, “So I asked a chatbot what I should do.”
Um. What? Simulations of human conversation powered by artificial intelligence—chatbots—have been much in the news, but I’d never had a patient tell me they’d actually used one for advice before.
“What did it tell you?” I asked, curious.
“To tell her that I care about her values.”
“Oh. Did it work?”
“Two guesses,” he sighed and turned up his hands. Although this patient was the first, it’s now become a regular occurrence in my therapy practice to hear from new patients that they have consulted chatbots before consulting me. Most often, it’s for love and relationship advice, but it might also be to connect or set boundaries with their children or to straighten out a friendship that has gone awry. The results have been decidedly mixed.
One new patient asked the chatbot how to handle the anniversary of a loved one’s death. Put aside time in your day to remember what was special about the person, advised the bot. I couldn’t have said it better myself.
“What it wrote made me cry,” the patient said. “I realized that I have been avoiding my grief. So, I made this appointment.”
Another patient started relying on AI when her friends began to wear thin. “I can’t burn out my chatbot,” she told me.
As a therapist, I’m both alarmed and intrigued by AI’s potential to enter the therapy business. There’s no doubt that AI is the future. Already, it has shown itself to be useful in everything from writing cover letters and speeches to planning trips and weddings. So why not let it help with our relationships as well? A new venture called Replika, the “AI companion who cares,” has taken it a step further and has even created romantic avatars for people to fall in love with. Other sites, like Character.ai, allow you to chat and hang out with your favorite fictional characters, or build a bot to talk to on your own.
But we live in an age of misinformation. We’ve already seen disturbing examples of how algorithms spread lies and conspiracy theories among unwitting or ill-intentioned humans. What will happen when we let them into our emotional lives?
“Even though AI may articulate things like a human, you have to ask yourself what its goal is,” says Naama Hoffman, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York City. “The goal in relationships or in therapy is to improve quality of life, whereas the goal of AI is to find what is cited most. It’s not supposed to help, necessarily.”
As a therapist, I know that my work can benefit from outside support. I have been running trauma groups for two decades, and I have seen how the scaffolding of a psychoeducational framework, especially an evidence-based one like Seeking Safety, facilitates deeper emotional work. After all, the original chatbot, Eliza, was designed to be a “virtual therapist” because it asked endlessly open questions—and you can still use it. Chatbots may help people find inspiration or even break down defenses and allow people to enter therapy. But where is the point at which people become overly dependent on machines?","One new patient asked the chatbot how to handle the anniversary of a loved one’s death. “What it wrote made me cry,” the patient said. “Even though AI may articulate things like a human, you have to ask yourself what its goal is,” says Naama Hoffman, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York City.

26,Using language models to understand neural activities in language models,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/using-language-models-to-understand-neural-activities-in-language-models/,"In a recent announcement, OpenAI, the leading artificial intelligence research laboratory, revealed that they have made significant progress in using machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance their explanations. While acknowledging the current limitations of their explanations, OpenAI is confident that ML can contribute to further improvements.
OpenAI’s research showed that by leveraging GPT-4, the latest iteration of their language processing model, they were able to increase explanation scores. This was achieved by requesting GPT-4 for potential counterexamples and then refining explanations based on the insights provided.
Another key finding from OpenAI’s study was the positive correlation between the size and capabilities of the explainer model and the explanation scores. As the capabilities of the model increased, so did the average score. However, even with the advanced GPT-4, the explanation quality still fell short of human performance, highlighting potential for further enhancements.
OpenAI’s researchers also experimented with different activation functions in the explained model’s architecture. By training models with various activation functions, they observed improved scores for explanations. This suggests that exploring alternative architectural designs could considerably augment the quality of explanations.
As part of their commitment to fostering collaboration and innovation, OpenAI will open-source their datasets and visualization tools related to GPT-4-generated explanations for all 307,200 neurons in GPT-2. Additionally, they will share code for explanation and scoring using publicly available models on the OpenAI API, encouraging the research community to contribute to the development of higher-scoring explanations and enhanced tools to explore GPT-2 based on explanations.
The research team at OpenAI discovered over 1,000 neurons with explanations that scored at least 0.8, indicating that these neurons play a crucial role in the top-activating behavior of the model, according to GPT-4. While most of these well-explained neurons may not be particularly noteworthy, the researchers also identified numerous neurons that GPT-4 struggled to comprehend. OpenAI hopes that as explanations improve, they will be able to quickly gain qualitative insights into the model computations.","As the capabilities of the model increased, so did the average score.

27,Personalized guidelines for ChatGPT,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/22/personalized-guidelines-for-chatgpt/,"OpenAI has announced the introduction of custom instructions, a new feature aimed at allowing users to personalize their experience with ChatGPT. This beta feature will be available starting today for users on the Plus plan, with plans to expand it to all users in the coming weeks.
The implementation of custom instructions comes as a response to the feedback received by OpenAI regarding the inconvenience of starting each ChatGPT conversation from scratch. Through conversations with users in 22 different countries, OpenAI has gained a deeper understanding of the crucial role that steerability plays in enabling the models to effectively reflect the diverse contexts and unique requirements of individual users.
With custom instructions, ChatGPT will now take into consideration the preferences or requirements provided by users when generating responses. Users no longer need to repeat their instructions or specific information in every conversation, as the model will automatically consider them each time it responds.
To illustrate the practical applications of this feature, OpenAI offers examples such as a teacher creating a lesson plan. Now, the teacher does not have to repeatedly specify that they are teaching 3rd grade science. Similarly, a developer who prefers efficient code in a language other than Python can mention it once, and the model will understand. Even grocery shopping for a large family becomes easier as the model can account for the required number of servings in the grocery list.
This introduction of custom instructions by OpenAI aims to enhance the user experience of ChatGPT, allowing individuals to tailor the AI’s responses to their specific needs and preferences. By minimizing the friction of repetition, this new feature promises to improve the efficiency and convenience of interacting with ChatGPT.","OpenAI has announced the introduction of custom instructions, a new feature aimed at allowing users to personalize their experience with ChatGPT.

33,"Lightspeed leads $2 million funding round for Gushwork.ai, enabling outsourcing of business tasks to AI-trained workforces",https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/lightspeed-leads-2-million-funding-round-for-gushwork-ai-enabling-outsourcing-of-business-tasks-to-ai-trained-workforces/,"Global platform Gushwork.ai has secured $2.1 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Lightspeed, with participation from B Capital, Sparrow Capital, Seaborne Capital, and Beenext. The startup, which launched in April, aims to advance business process outsourcing (BPO) by leveraging AI and human expertise.
In recent years, companies have invested significant amounts of money in hiring skilled professionals to oversee operational processes such as administration, HR, payroll management, and customer support. Outsourcing these operations to staffing agencies or using platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to find freelancers has become a popular alternative to in-house hiring. However, the ongoing inflation has made this option increasingly expensive.
Gushwork.ai seeks to address this issue by offering an AI-powered, cross-border platform. The startup provides a curated marketplace featuring offshore workers trained in using various AI applications to help businesses carry out their processes efficiently. By outsourcing tedious workflows to Gushwork.ai’s platform, entrepreneurs can focus on strategically important tasks.
Co-founder and CEO Nayrhit Bhattacharya describes the process as “uberizing the employee workforce” because businesses can hire talent from different markets for their manually driven operational functions on a part-time basis. Bhattacharya, along with co-founder Adithya Venkatesh, launched Gushwork.ai in January with a usage-based pricing model.
According to Bhattacharya, businesses no longer need to hire full-time employees. Instead, they can utilize workers for a few hours one week and then not use them for another week. This flexible approach allows companies to access offshore talent without the long-term commitment.
In addition to providing part-time access to offshore talent, Gushwork.ai trains and equips its workforce with AI tools, enabling them to perform creative tasks that were previously considered outside the realm of AI capabilities. Tasks such as generating photorealistic blog designs, converting webinars to blogs, writing blog posts on various topics, or performing search engine optimization can now be handled by AI-powered tools. This eliminates the need for businesses to spend time and resources searching for specific skill sets on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr.
Gushwork.ai’s AI-augmented workforce is currently trained to perform tasks related to sales and marketing operations, including lead prospecting, email marketing, ad management, lead engagement on social media platforms, webinar moderation and marketing, social media management, responding to inbound leads, CRM setup, social media analytics data scraping, prospect outreach, and ad campaign management. The startup plans to expand into more specialized roles in the future.
Since its launch, Gushwork.ai has attracted over 50 businesses, which have delegated more than 200 complex workflows to the platform within the first three months of operation. Bhattacharya revealed that around 80% of its customers actively use the platform on a weekly basis, while nearly 90% use it monthly.
The startup primarily targets small and medium businesses and bootstrapped startups in the U.S. and Canada, with team sizes ranging from two to 20-30 members. Currently, around 80% of its customer base consists of small and medium businesses. While developed economies dominate its market, Gushwork.ai has also seen customers from India, which along with the Philippines, serves as the startup’s initial supply base for offshore talent. However, Gushwork.ai plans to establish a workforce base in different countries over time.
Lightspeed partner Rahul Taneja expressed excitement about the partnership, stating, “Gushwork.ai is leveraging this tailwind of cross-border cost arbitrage and is building a unique platform for businesses to delegate some of their most complex workflows to an elite on-demand offshore workforce trained on AI tools and apps.”
With the fresh funding, Gushwork.ai plans to enhance quality control and data security and privacy. The startup also aims to develop features that allow businesses to create and document complex processes within its platform, using them as large training datasets to automate workflows. Additionally, Gushwork.ai intends to invest in content-led organic market and personal building channels to reach new customers.","The startup primarily targets small and medium businesses and bootstrapped startups in the U.S. and Canada, with team sizes ranging from two to 20-30 members.

34,Wired: AI Company in the Battlefield Claims to be a Force for Good,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/wired-ai-company-in-the-battlefield-claims-to-be-a-force-for-good/,"In the constantly evolving world of technology, it’s not surprising to see the rise of companies like Helsing, who are striving to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and national defense. Their job adverts are imbued with idealism, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic values. Helsing’s three founders draw inspiration from past events such as Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014, which they see as a wake-up call for Europe to be prepared for potential aggressions.
Worries grew for Helsing’s founders, particularly after witnessing Google employees protesting against a deal with the Pentagon in 2018. The controversial deal involved using AI to analyze drone footage for military purposes. Over 4,000 employees signed a letter voicing their concerns about the ethical implications of aiding military surveillance. In response, Google decided not to renew the contract. This incident left Helsing’s founders questioning the logic behind such a decision.
If the best engineers at Big Tech companies like Google were reluctant to work on defense projects, Helsing’s founders wondered who would step up. They fear that without collaboration between the tech industry and the defense sector, Western societies might fall behind in terms of technological advancements. Their conviction lies in the belief that protecting open and free societies requires the ability to defend them.
Helsing, like other defense industry companies, often faces challenges in discussing the transparency of their tools. Claiming that it would compromise their tools’ effectiveness, they refrain from sharing intricate details about them. Instead, they project an image of AI that is compatible with democratic principles. They emphasize values such as privacy and freedom, stating that their AI is focused on object recognition rather than facial recognition.
Despite their intentions, the increased automation in the defense sector raises complex ethical issues. Herbert Lin, a senior research scholar at Stanford University, warns that if AI systems like Helsing’s are linked to autonomous weapons, human decision-makers must resist the pressure to connect them. He stresses the importance of human accountability in the face of potential mistakes. When autonomous weapons make decisions, who will bear responsibility if unintended consequences occur?
To dispel concerns, Helsing’s co-founder, Riel, emphasizes that they do not create autonomous weapons. Instead, their mission is to develop AI systems that enhance human understanding of situations. Presently, when using Helsing’s platform to take down a drone, it is a human operator who makes the final decision, not the AI. However, concerns persist about the extent of human autonomy when working closely with AI. Jensen from the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggests that users who lack a complete understanding of the tools they are using may either trust AI too much or too little, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences.","They fear that without collaboration between the tech industry and the defense sector, Western societies might fall behind in terms of technological advancements.

36,The Potential Impact of Ubiquitous Radio Waves in Healthcare,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/the-potential-impact-of-ubiquitous-radio-waves-in-healthcare/,"Dina Katabi, the Andrew & Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, has expressed her excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing patient monitoring in healthcare. Katabi is also the co-founder of Emerald Innovations, a company that aims to implement data-rich solutions to improve early intervention in clinical settings and provide applications for client companies like Verge Genomics and BlueRock Therapeutics.
During her presentation, Katabi emphasized the importance of clinical data in shaping the future of healthcare. She highlighted the need for continuous clinical data and explained how it can contribute to significant advancements in healthcare. Katabi envisions a future where clinical data is collected continuously from patients in their homes to track symptoms and their evolution. This data can then be processed using machine learning techniques to gain insights and detect potential problems before they occur. By intervening early and avoiding hospitalization, patient outcomes can be greatly improved.
To illustrate her point, Katabi showed images of patients connected to needles, electrodes, and complex monitors, emphasizing the discomfort and limitations of the traditional methods of obtaining clinical data. She argued that sporadic data points collected over time fail to capture the dynamics of symptom evolutions in diseases.
Katabi proposed an alternative approach using wireless systems that utilize ubiquitous radio signals to gather patient data on vitals and more, enabling continuous monitoring at home or any other location. She presented a video demonstrating how these wireless systems can accurately track individuals’ activities, such as walking or sitting, and integrate this information to improve diagnosis accuracy.
Katabi also discussed the potential of wireless IoT systems for diagnosing various health conditions, particularly in sleep monitoring. She explained that a range of health conditions can be correlated with sleep symptoms and suggested using wireless systems to obtain the necessary diagnostic data instead of undergoing invasive sleep lab tests. For instance, early rapid eye movement during sleep can indicate depression, and impairment of slow waves in deep sleep can be a predictor of Alzheimer’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease was another area of focus for Katabi. She highlighted that it is the fastest-growing neurological condition globally, and the current diagnosis often comes too late when substantial brain damage has already occurred. Katabi proposed leveraging machine learning to detect Parkinson’s disease before motor symptoms manifest. Drawing on input from the original discoverer of Parkinson’s, James Parkinson, she explained that breathing patterns can indicate a risk for the disease. Katabi showcased an Emerald system that achieved up to 90% accuracy based on follow-up data from a study of 7,600 patients. This early detection capability could significantly improve the development of drugs and treatments for Parkinson’s.
In conclusion, Katabi emphasized that the potential of AI in medicine and biomedical research is just beginning to be explored. She expressed her team’s goal of bringing this technology to healthcare and drug development, and her belief that computer science can revolutionize these fields.","She explained that a range of health conditions can be correlated with sleep symptoms and suggested using wireless systems to obtain the necessary diagnostic data instead of undergoing invasive sleep lab tests.

37,"Llama, the ChatGPT competitor, unveiled by Meta",https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/llama-the-chatgpt-competitor-unveiled-by-meta/,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has unveiled its new artificial intelligence system called “Llama 2,” which is set to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot. The announcement was made by Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stated that the new AI system, developed in partnership with Microsoft, is free to use for both research and commercial purposes, distinguishing it from its competitors.
This move by Meta and Microsoft intends to “democratise AI and its benefits.” Llama 2 follows the previous version of the AI system called Llama, which was released in February but leaked onto the internet in March and was subsequently modified by the public.
In contrast to other Big Tech companies that develop large AI language models, Meta and Microsoft take an open approach, offering researchers and companies visibility into the data and code they use to build their AI. The companies believe that this open approach is essential for the development of AI models, particularly in the generative space where technology is rapidly advancing.
By providing businesses, startups, entrepreneurs, and researchers access to tools developed at a large scale, backed by robust computing power, Meta and Microsoft aim to unlock opportunities for experimentation, innovation, and ultimately economic and social benefits, according to a blog post by Meta.
Llama 2 stands apart from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard as it is open source. Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of open source in driving innovation, improving safety, and security, stating that “more people can scrutinize [open] software to identify and fix potential issues.” Meta’s decision to open-source Llama 2 aligns with this belief.
Despite Meta’s claims of open-sourcing Llama 2, the specific data used to train the AI system remains unclear. The accompanying research paper states that the model was trained on a mix of publicly available data, excluding data from Meta’s own products or services. However, it does not provide further details about the specific sources of the data used.
According to Meta, the new AI models can be downloaded directly or accessed through partnerships, making them available on Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure. Llama 2 is optimized to run locally on Windows and is also offered through other providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Hugging Face.","The companies believe that this open approach is essential for the development of AI models, particularly in the generative space where technology is rapidly advancing. In contrast to other Big Tech companies that develop large AI language models, Meta and Microsoft take an open approach, offering researchers and companies visibility into the data and code they use to build their AI. The announcement was made by Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stated that the new AI system, developed in partnership with Microsoft, is free to use for both research and commercial purposes, distinguishing it from its competitors. Despite Meta’s claims of open-sourcing Llama 2, the specific data used to train the AI system remains unclear. This move by Meta and Microsoft intends to “democratise AI and its benefits.” Llama 2 follows the previous version of the AI system called Llama, which was released in February but leaked onto the internet in March and was subsequently modified by the public.",https://ainewstoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Llama-the-ChatGPT-competitor-unveiled-by-Meta-1024x683.jpg,2023-07-20
38,Meta unveils Llama 2 as an open-source LLM,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/meta-unveils-llama-2-as-an-open-source-llm/,"Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has made headlines once again with the introduction of Llama 2, an open-source family of AI language models. These models, which range in size from 7-70 billion parameters, are set to make a big impact in the field of AI.
Meta claims that the Llama 2 models “outperform open source chat models on most benchmarks we tested.” This is a significant achievement and marks a turning point in the large language model (LLM) market. Industry experts and enthusiasts are already showing interest in this new development.
The Llama 2 models come in two variants: pretrained and fine-tuned. The pretrained models have been trained on a massive two trillion tokens and have a context window of 4,096 tokens, enabling them to process vast amounts of content at once. The fine-tuned models, on the other hand, have been trained on “over one million human annotations,” which further enhances their language processing capabilities, specifically for chat applications like ChatGPT.
While Llama 2 may not yet rival OpenAI’s GPT-4, it shows incredible promise as an open-source model. In fact, Jim Fan, an AI enthusiast, took to Twitter to announce the release of Llama-2 and hailed it as the best OSS (open-source software) model currently available.
The journey of Llama 2 started with its predecessor, LLaMA, which was released by Meta as open source with a non-commercial license in February. Unfortunately, the weights of LLaMA were leaked to torrent sites, leading to a surge in its usage within the AI community and paving the way for a growing underground LLM development scene.
While open-source AI models like Llama 2 have their advantages, including transparency in training data, economic competition, and democratized access to AI, critics raise concerns about potential risks such as misuse in synthetic biology, spam generation, and disinformation. In response to these concerns, Meta released a statement emphasizing its commitment to responsible and open innovation, which encourages transparency and trust in AI technologies.
However, despite the benefits of open-source models, some critics remain skeptical, particularly about the lack of transparency in the training data used for LLMs. Although Meta claims to have made efforts to remove data containing personal information, the specific sources of training data remain undisclosed, raising privacy and ethical concerns.","Meta claims that the Llama 2 models “outperform open source chat models on most benchmarks we tested.” This is a significant achievement and marks a turning point in the large language model (LLM) market.

40,The EU Calls on the US to Join Efforts in Regulating AI,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/the-eu-calls-on-the-us-to-join-efforts-in-regulating-ai/,"The power dynamics between the US and the European Union (EU) when it comes to regulating tech giants have come under scrutiny. As the world’s most valuable and dominant internet companies are based in the US, it is the nation’s lawmakers and business-friendly courts that have effectively outsourced the regulation of these tech giants to the EU. Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, holds the responsibility for crafting and enforcing laws that apply across the 27-nation bloc, and after nearly four years on the job, he is tired of hearing big talk from the US with little action.
Ahead of his latest round of biannual meetings with US officials, including attorney general Merrick Garland in Washington, DC, Reynders shared his thoughts with WIRED on why the US needs to finally step up. He also discussed the ongoing probe into ChatGPT and his controversial comments about one of the world’s most prominent privacy activists. Reynders kicked off his tour with a Waymo robotaxi ride through San Francisco, which he enthusiastically reviewed, and went on to hold meetings with Google and California’s privacy czar.
Reynders emphasized the costs of US inaction. It has been five years since the EU’s strict privacy law, the GDPR, went into effect, granting Europeans new rights to protect and control their data. While Reynders has heard several proposals on how the US could follow suit, including from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other tech executives, Facebook whistleblowers, and members of Congress and federal officials, there has been no real follow-up. Although the US Federal Trade Commission has reached settlements with tech companies that require diligence with user data under threat of fines, Reynders remains skeptical about their power. According to him, “enforcement is of the essence,” and this is exactly what he wants to discuss with US authorities.
Reynders also expressed concerns about the lack of regulation surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Despite tech leaders like Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, expressing the need for new safeguards, American lawmakers seem unlikely to pass new laws. Reynders believes that if the US and EU can establish a common approach, an international standard can be put in place. However, if the EU’s forthcoming AI Act is not matched with US rules for AI, it will be challenging to hold tech giants fully accountable and bring about necessary changes in the industry. Reynders stressed the importance of real action on the US side to make progress easier.
Turning to ChatGPT, Reynders highlighted the growing scrutiny it faces from both privacy and AI-specific regulatory efforts. OpenAI made changes to its privacy options and disclosures after Italy’s data protection authority temporarily blocked ChatGPT. A full investigation into the company’s GDPR compliance is due by October, and the EU-wide data protection task force expects to issue common principles for all member nations regarding ChatGPT by the end of the year. Such developments could force OpenAI to make further adjustments to the data collection and retention policies of its chatbot.
Reynders also addressed concerns raised by Sam Altman about potential overregulation. While Altman has supported calls for new rules governing AI systems, he has expressed fears about stifling innovation. Reynders clarified that Altman has a significant business incentive to cooperate with the EU, given its larger population. Reynders assured that all major actors would be included in the discussions to understand their concerns and work towards addressing them through legislation. He believes that OpenAI should not fear new AI rules, as the intention behind the company’s founding aligns with a common goal of developing new technologies for the greater good.","Reynders stressed the importance of real action on the US side to make progress easier.

41,FedML Secures $11.5 Million Funding to Merge MLOps Tools with a Decentralized AI Compute Network,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/20/fedml-secures-11-5-million-funding-to-merge-mlops-tools-with-a-decentralized-ai-compute-network/,"The popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) in the enterprise sector is on the rise, according to a recent survey. The study found that nearly two-thirds of companies plan to increase or maintain their spending on AI and machine learning this year. However, many companies are facing challenges when it comes to deploying different forms of AI into production.
A poll conducted by Rexer Analytics in 2020 revealed that only 11% of AI models are always deployed. In addition, a Gartner analyst estimated that approximately 85% of big data projects fail. These statistics highlight the obstacles that companies encounter when it comes to implementing AI effectively.
In an effort to address these challenges, Salman Avestimehr, the inaugural director of the USC-Amazon Center on Trustworthy Machine Learning, co-founded a startup called FedML. The company aims to enable companies to train, deploy, monitor, and improve AI models on the cloud or edge. FedML recently raised $11.5 million in seed funding at a valuation of $56.5 million, led by Camford Capital, with participation from Road Capital and Finality Capital.
Avestimehr explained that many businesses are interested in training or fine-tuning custom AI models specific to their needs. However, building and maintaining these models can be prohibitively expensive due to high data, cloud infrastructure, and engineering costs. Additionally, the proprietary data used to train custom models is often sensitive, regulated, or siloed.
FedML aims to overcome these barriers by providing a collaborative AI platform that allows companies and developers to work together on AI tasks by sharing data, models, and compute resources. The platform can run custom AI models or models from the open source community. Customers can create a group of collaborators and automatically sync AI applications across their devices. They can also track the training progress in real time.
FedML recently introduced FedLLM, a training pipeline designed for building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) using proprietary data. This new feature is compatible with popular LLM libraries such as Hugging Face’s and Microsoft’s DeepSpeed. Avestimehr believes that FedLLM can improve the speed of custom AI development while ensuring security and privacy.
While FedML is not unique in the field of MLOps platforms, which streamline the process of taking AI models to production and maintaining and monitoring them, it has broader ambitions. Avestimehr aims to build a community of CPU and GPU resources to host and serve models once they are ready for deployment. Although the specifics have yet to be determined, FedML plans to incentivize users to contribute compute power to the platform through tokens or other forms of compensation.
Distributed and decentralized compute for AI model serving is not a new concept, with companies like Gensys, Run.AI, and Petals attempting similar approaches. Nevertheless, Avestimehr believes that combining this compute paradigm with an MLOps suite can lead to greater success for FedML.
FedML currently has around 10 paying customers, including a “tier one” automotive supplier, and a total of $13.5 million in funding. The platform is being used by over 3,000 users globally and has performed over 8,500 training jobs across more than 10,000 devices.","The study found that nearly two-thirds of companies plan to increase or maintain their spending on AI and machine learning this year.

42,SoftBank leads $65M investment in Tractable for AI-based appraisals of car and property damage,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/18/softbank-leads-65m-investment-in-tractable-for-ai-based-appraisals-of-car-and-property-damage/,"In the world of insurance, artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be a game-changer, and Tractable is at the forefront of this transformation. The startup, which specializes in computer vision and AI, has just secured $65 million in funding in a Series E round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with participation from Insight Partners and Georgian. This funding will enable Tractable to continue expanding its business and invest further in the Japanese market.
Tractable’s platform is currently processing around $7 billion in claims annually, working with insurance giants like Aviva, Geico, and Admiral. With the new funding, the company aims not only to grow its existing business but also to incorporate more advanced AI technologies. CEO and founder Alex Dalyac envisions a future where Tractable’s AI can not only assess damage to property and cars but also provide advice on repairs, maintenance, and sales.
Japan is a particularly important market for Tractable, as it has seen significant growth in property appraisals for natural disaster recovery and in the automotive aftermarket vertical. The pandemic-induced labor and parts shortages have driven the need for faster and more efficient processes, making Tractable’s technology highly sought after.
Despite the company’s success, it faces competition from numerous other players in the market, such as Uveye, ProovStation, Ravin, Claims Genius, and Innovation Group. These companies also offer AI-based solutions for remote assessments. However, Tractable’s early mover advantage and strong partnerships with insurance giants give it a significant edge.
It’s worth noting that SoftBank’s involvement as the lead investor is intriguing, given its reduced activity in the VC space in recent months. The company faced substantial losses due to high valuations and rapid investments in the past. However, SoftBank’s interest in Tractable reflects its belief in the potential of AI technology and its desire to explore new use cases.
Japan’s digital-first consumer base and its enthusiasm for AI and robotics make it an ideal market for Tractable. The country’s status as the world’s largest automotive manufacturer further amplifies the potential for integration and collaboration. Tractable aims to leverage its technology to not only assess damages but also participate in the repair, protection, and recycling of vehicles.
Despite its progress, Tractable remains unprofitable, as do many other venture capital-backed companies. Dalyac attributes this to a decade of low interest rates and an abundance of VC funding, which prioritized growth over profitability. However, the current interest rate environment is forcing a shift towards profitability, and Tractable is making substantial progress towards that goal.
In conclusion, Tractable’s latest funding round and strategic partnership with SoftBank highlight the growing importance of AI in the insurance industry. With its advanced computer vision and AI capabilities, Tractable is well-positioned to expand its services and dominate the market. As the tech sector faces increasing pressure to be profitable, Tractable is making strides towards achieving profitability and becoming a leader in the field.

43,Superintelligence: Examining its Governance,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/18/superintelligence-examining-its-governance/,"In a recent blog post, OpenAI has highlighted the need for strong public oversight in the governance and deployment of AI systems. They believe that people worldwide should have a democratic say in determining the boundaries and defaults for these systems. While they admit to not having a fully developed mechanism for achieving this yet, they are committed to experimenting with its development.
It’s an interesting stance to take, considering the power that AI systems possess. OpenAI acknowledges that individual users should have significant control over how the AI they use behaves, but they also underscore the importance of wider public involvement in decision-making. It seems they are grappling with the challenge of striking a balance between individual autonomy and collective responsibility.
But why are they building this technology in the first place, given the risks and difficulties involved? OpenAI outlines two fundamental reasons. First, they foresee the potential for a much better world through the application of AI, particularly in areas such as education, creative work, and personal productivity. They believe this technology can contribute to solving the world’s problems and improve society as a whole. The possibilities for economic growth and an increase in quality of life are described as astonishing.
The second reason is rooted in the notion that stopping the creation of superintelligence would be both risky and challenging. OpenAI argues that the benefits associated with superintelligence are so significant that the cost of building it decreases over time. Additionally, the number of actors working on it is rapidly growing. They suggest that it is an inherent part of our technological progress, making it extremely difficult to halt. The prospect of stopping superintelligence altogether would require something like a global surveillance regime, which is far from guaranteed to be effective.
This is a thought-provoking perspective from OpenAI. They recognize the need for public oversight while maintaining that AI has the potential to bring about positive change. At the same time, they raise valid concerns about the feasibility of preventing the development of superintelligence. It’s clear that OpenAI understands the weight of responsibility they carry and the importance of getting it right. The future of AI governance and its impact on society is undoubtedly a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and collaboration.

44,‘Boundary-Free’ WormGPT Emerges as a Dark Web Offering for Hackers,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/18/boundary-free-wormgpt-emerges-as-a-dark-web-offering-for-hackers/,"In a chilling revelation, cyber security firm SlashNext has uncovered a dangerous new AI tool known as WormGPT, which is being advertised on the dark web as a potent weapon for hackers. Unlike other popular AI models like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, WormGPT has no built-in protections against malicious use, offering hackers an unprecedented level of sophistication in carrying out cyber attacks. Described as a “sophisticated AI model,” WormGPT is capable of generating human-like text that can be leveraged in hacking campaigns.
SlashNext conducted several tests using WormGPT, instructing it to create an email aimed at pressuring an unsuspecting account manager into paying a fraudulent invoice. The results were both astounding and deeply concerning. Not only did WormGPT produce a persuasive email, but it also demonstrated strategic cunning, highlighting its potential for sophisticated phishing attacks. Screenshots shared by the anonymous developer on a hacking forum showcased the AI tool’s ability to write code for malware attacks and craft emails specifically designed to deceive.
This news comes on the heels of a recent report from Europol, warning about the potential exploitation of large language models like ChatGPT by cyber criminals. According to the report, ChatGPT’s proficiency in generating highly authentic texts makes it a valuable tool for phishing scams. Even individuals with a basic grasp of the English language can now impersonate organizations or individuals convincingly, thanks to the advanced capabilities of AI.
The implications of this development are highly troubling. With WormGPT in the hands of hackers, cyber attacks can be carried out faster, more authentically, and on a significantly larger scale. The sophistication and realism exhibited by these AI tools mark a new era of cybercrime, outpacing the traditional methods of detection. It’s clear that more needs to be done to prevent the misuse of AI technology and protect individuals and organizations from the devastating consequences of cyber attacks.
As the anonymous developer of WormGPT proudly claims it to be “the biggest enemy of the well-known ChatGPT,” it seems that the battle for control over AI’s potential for good or ill is raging on. The question remains: how can we harness the power of AI for positive advancements, while simultaneously guarding against its exploitation by those with nefarious intentions?

45,Companies Embrace the Creative Prospects of Digital Humans as Hollywood Grapples with AI-Triggered Strikes,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/18/companies-embrace-the-creative-prospects-of-digital-humans-as-hollywood-grapples-with-ai-triggered-strikes/,"In the midst of a strike by Hollywood actors and writers, one of their primary concerns is the potential impact of generative AI on their industry. Fran Drescher, president of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union, stated in a news conference that AI poses an “existential threat” to creative professions. Drescher argued that actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without their consent and fair compensation.
However, some high-flying generative AI video startups, such as Synthesia, Hour One, and Soul Machines, have a different perspective on the matter. They see AI-generated avatars, or digital humans, as having significant creative potential for businesses, Hollywood, and celebrities who willingly consent to the use of their AI likenesses.
Natalie Monbiot, head of strategy at Hour One, dislikes the term “deepfakes” when referring to the use of synthetic media and generative AI. She emphasizes that their company operates with authorization from the beginning. The goal is to use synthetic media, in the form of virtual humans, to address the costly, complex, and unscalable challenges of traditional video production. Synthetic media allows for content to be produced quickly, easily, and in different languages, making it an attractive option for businesses seeking scalable video content.
Recently, Soul Machines announced a partnership with K-Pop celebrity Mark Tuan, where they launched “Digital Mark,” a digital avatar with which fans can have one-on-one conversations on various topics. With K-Pop’s global fan base expanding, Tuan’s Digital Twin will enable him to communicate in multiple languages, starting with English and eventually adding Korean and Japanese capabilities.
Jon Starck, the CTO of Synthesia, believes that digital humans have creative and efficiency potential that cannot be ignored. He sees video as a storytelling medium that is both visual and engaging, but he considers the process of creating video to be the least creative aspect. With AI-powered video generation, he believes that everyone can become a great storyteller. Starck envisions a future where entire movies can be created from synthetic data. This is a field he has been dedicated to for two decades, working in computer vision for the film industry. He believes that the problems he faces today are similar to those he encountered 20 years ago, only now there are more advanced tools and capabilities available.
Synthesia has made significant progress in representing human performance at high-fidelity, a vital component in applications such as film production and video conferencing. Their AI research project, HumanRF, captures the full-body appearance in motion of a human being and allows playback from novel viewpoints. To create the dataset necessary for this project, Synthesia needed real actors to capture their movements and performances. This dataset, called ActorsHQ, consists of 39,765 frames of dynamic human motion captured using a multi-view video system. The actors involved were enthusiastic about contributing to the future of 3D representations for synthetic actors.
When asked about the concerns raised by striking Hollywood writers and actors, Starck emphasized that Synthesia is not in the business of replacing actors or movie creation. Their objective is to replace text for communication and provide synthetic video as a tool for businesses. However, Starck acknowledges that inventions like AI can be viewed as new enablers for creativity. In the movie industry, where producing a few seconds of a blockbuster movie can take 18 months and millions of dollars, he sees the AI explosion as something that empowers humanity’s creativity.
Overall, the debate surrounding generative AI in Hollywood is ongoing. While some actors and writers see it as a threat to their livelihoods, AI video startups like Synthesia envision a future where AI-generated avatars can revolutionize video content production and enhance creative possibilities. Time will tell how these differing perspectives will shape the future of the entertainment industry.

52,Transforming AI Art into Stunning Poster Prints,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/17/transforming-ai-art-into-stunning-poster-prints/,"The quality of images produced by generative AI art services is truly remarkable. However, there’s a major drawback—they are usually too small to print at a larger size. But don’t worry, there is a quick and effective solution to this problem!
The reason behind the small image size is that generating AI images requires a lot of processing power. To save on cloud computing resources, most AI art services churn out images at a relatively low resolution. While this is fine for website use, it becomes a problem when you want to print your AI creations or use them for posters, newspapers, or magazines. The small size of these images leads to pixelation and blurriness when printed at size.
Fortunately, there is a clever workaround that doesn’t involve the use of upscalers, which often produce fuzzy and synthetic-looking results. This technique relies on vector graphics, which are images created from curved points and lines that can be infinitely scaled. Unlike regular JPEG images, vector graphics remain smooth even when enlarged to the size of an aircraft hangar!
Most generative AI art services cannot create images in the standard SVG format, which is necessary for vector graphics. However, you can use the text prompts to instruct the AI to create an image in the style of vector graphics. Then, you can convert these images to true vector graphics using free online services.
For example, let’s take Midjourney as an example. By adding phrases like “vector art” or “vector graphics” to the text prompt, you can generate an image that resembles vector graphics. However, the generated image is still in the PNG format and will be blurry if printed at larger sizes. To solve this issue, you can use a free online service called Vectorizer.ai to convert the PNG image into true vector graphics. The result is a sharp and clear image that doesn’t blur or pixelate when zoomed in.
Once you’ve obtained the vectorized image, you can convert it to a PDF and have it printed at any size you desire. There are free online services like Cloud Convert that can convert SVG images to PDF, but they might not offer much control over the size and quality of the final result. If you have access to Adobe Illustrator, it provides better results. Simply open the SVG file in Illustrator, save it as a PDF, and select the “High Quality Print” preset to ensure a fantastic, high-quality PDF that can be printed at any size.
So, if you’ve been struggling with the limitations of small AI-generated images, this technique opens up a whole new world of possibilities. You can now turn your AI creations into stunning, large-scale prints that will impress anyone who lays eyes on them.

Patients could access secure communication, exchange images, and receive expert medical guidance whenever and wherever they needed it. As their prototype gained traction, other medical specialties sought to leverage their software, and ORO Health was established as a dedicated technology platform.
Through their platform, patients can securely access private telemedicine services. The process is simple: patients provide relevant information, capture images of their condition, complete payment, and submit their case via secured encryption. Doctors can then review the data, examine the images, ask follow-up questions, provide diagnoses, prescribe treatments, and even send prescriptions directly to the patient’s pharmacy. This asynchronous model of care enables patients to receive timely medical attention without the need for physical appointments.
Morel emphasized the advanced imaging capabilities of smartphones, which allow healthcare professionals to better examine and analyze skin conditions. Modern phones can zoom in to the detail of the skin, enabling more accurate diagnoses. This technology empowers patients to take an active role in their healthcare journey and receive ongoing care remotely through ORO Health’s follow-up system.
Canada’s healthcare system is facing a significant crisis, characterized by long wait times and limited access to care. The Fraser Institute’s annual survey of physicians in Canada revealed that wait times reached a record high in 2022. The strain on the system has been further exacerbated by an aging population and a shortage of healthcare professionals. ORO Health aims to address this issue by incorporating AI-driven diagnostic solutions to enable family doctors to make more accurate initial diagnoses and start treatment for certain conditions. This will mitigate unnecessary referrals and delays in accessing specialist care.
Privacy and security of patient information is a top priority for ORO Health. They employ end-to-end encryption to safeguard sensitive medical data and ensure confidentiality. Anonymization and data protection processes are also in place to ensure patient results remain confidential and unlinked to personal information.
The advantages of ORO Health’s AI-driven solutions are numerous. Doctors experience increased efficiency, as what previously required 30 to 45 minutes can often be resolved within one to two minutes. The asynchronous nature of telemedicine reduces wait times and streamlines the diagnostic process. For patients, ORO Health provides accessible and convenient care, particularly for minor dermatological conditions. Patients have immediate access to specialist guidance, eliminating the need for lengthy waits or unnecessary visits to dermatologists.
Looking ahead, the future of healthcare diagnosis lies in the hybridization of traditional medical practices as technology advances. ORO Health envisions a healthcare landscape where technology plays a vital role in optimizing patient experiences, improving efficiency, and easing the burden on healthcare systems. By harnessing the power of AI and telemedicine, ORO Health is contributing to a more accessible and patient-centric future.
On the 21st of July, ORO Health will release its first AI product, the DermSmart, which will soon be certified software under Medical Device Class I. As Canada seeks to address its healthcare crisis, technologies like ORO Health’s AI-driven diagnostic solutions are already reshaping the medical process, enabling accurate and efficient diagnosis, facilitating seamless communication between doctors and patients, and ultimately driving improved patient outcomes.

56,Artificial Intelligence Didn’t Pioneer Innovative Remixing,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/17/artificial-intelligence-didnt-pioneer-innovative-remixing/,"In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a group of artists and writers who called themselves the Beat Generation took up residence in a dilapidated hotel in Paris, known fondly as The Beat Hotel. This scrappy establishment became a hotbed of creativity and artistic cross-pollination, as the close proximity of these individuals fueled their experimentation with drugs, sex, and, most importantly, creativity. It was here that Brion Gysin, one of the hotel’s residents, came up with an idea called cut ups.
Gysin’s cut ups involved using a utility knife to carefully slice into books or periodicals, and then rearranging and pasting the cuttings onto a piece of paper to create something entirely new. However, some of the original authors whose work was being repurposed didn’t take kindly to this artistic recycling, according to author Barry Miles.
Fast forward to today, and we can see a similar dynamic unfolding with the rise of generative AI. This technology allows for the repurposing and reimagining of artwork and words, creating a new tension between traditional artists and this new generation of creators. Just as Gysin’s work stirred up controversy in the countercultural revolution of the 1960s, generative AI is now shaking up the art world.
A key figure in this evolving landscape is Scott Belsky, the chief strategy officer at Adobe. Belsky’s journey with the company began in 2012 when Adobe acquired his startup, Behance, for a whopping $150 million. In 2019, Behance introduced Moodboards, a platform that allows artists to collect artistic inspirations as a starting point for their own creations. This innovative feature aimed to give artists a boost in their creative process.
The use of generative AI and platforms like Behance’s Moodboards highlights a shift in the artistic landscape, where traditional notions of authorship and originality are being challenged. As artists navigate this new terrain, they must grapple with questions of ownership and creativity in the age of artificial intelligence.
While some may fear that generative AI will render traditional artistic practices obsolete, there is reason to believe that truly creative jobs will endure. Despite the rise of technology, human creativity still possesses that elusive spark that sets it apart from algorithms and machines. As the art world continues to evolve, it is crucial to find a balance between innovation and the preservation of human ingenuity. After all, no matter how advanced technology becomes, there will always be a unique magic to the work of human artists.

It’s crucial to recognize that AI has the potential to foster an “intuition economy.” Generative AI can provide access to vast amounts of knowledge, making it easier for professionals like lawyers to access information and perform their tasks more efficiently. Rather than replacing humans, AI will push us to become smarter and more creative. The value of pure knowledge will decrease, while the importance of utilizing that knowledge for innovation and new insights will rise.
Goldman Sachs predicts that generative AI could automate around 300 million jobs worldwide. However, the historical trend suggests that new jobs will emerge to offset the displacement caused by automation. Successful individuals and companies will be those who can connect diverse streams of information and derive meaningful insights from them. The real innovations will happen in the “unknown world,” where AI streamlines knowledge accumulation, and humans focus on unlocking mysteries that were previously beyond our reach. The future lies in building proprietary value on top of commoditized knowledge.
It’s important to acknowledge that AI is an unstoppable force. Technology has been accelerating at an unprecedented rate, and AI is no exception. While it’s crucial to assess its impact and establish appropriate safeguards, the reality is that AI cannot be stopped or significantly slowed down. The benefits and profit potential are too great. Instead, we should approach AI with the right questions, without panic, and prepare ourselves for the AI-driven future that lies ahead.
In conclusion, the debate around AI should be rational, not hysterical. AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and spur innovation. Although concerns exist, we must recognize that AI’s impact is not predetermined doom but an opportunity for us to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing technological landscape.

61,TechCrunch Pays Tribute to the Legacy of Joanne Pransky,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/16/techcrunch-pays-tribute-to-the-legacy-of-joanne-pransky/,"When news of Joanne Pransky’s death broke last month, it seemed like everyone knew her. I reached out to my LinkedIn followers to see if anyone had a personal connection with her, and the response was overwhelming. It’s clear that Pransky has had a lasting impact on the robotics and automation industry, bringing a unique human element to the conversation.
Helen Greiner, iRobot co-founder and Tertill CEO, described Pransky as the embodiment of “Think Different.” She recognized the significance of robots in society and understood the reciprocal relationship between humans and machines. Pransky called herself the “world’s first real Robotic Psychiatrist,” using her expertise to bridge the gap between humans and robots. Her goal was to help people understand their emotional, social, and psychological responses to robotic technologies, which will undoubtedly play a significant role in our lives in the future.
Pransky’s work involved collaborating with developers to make robotic systems more adaptable to human society. At other times, she had the challenging task of convincing people that robots aren’t the villains depicted in science fiction. Her efforts took her to prestigious stages like TEDx, “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,” and even a three-year stint as a judge on Comedy Central’s “BattleBots” competition.
Science fiction was a crucial source of inspiration for Pransky. She recounted a meeting with acclaimed author Isaac Asimov, where she updated him on real-world breakthroughs in robotics. Asimov even called her “the real-life Susan Calvin,” a nod to a character in his collection of short stories, “I, Robot.” However, according to Robin Murphy, a professor at Texas A&M Department of Computer Science & Engineering, the comparison wasn’t quite accurate. Pransky, unlike Susan Calvin, was a warm and sociable person who had a loving family. But if there was ever a woman who represented Asimov’s vision for robotics, it would undoubtedly be Pransky.
News of Pransky’s passing was first announced by Robin Murphy in her tribute on Robohub. Murphy recognizes Pransky as one of the pioneers of human-centered robotics, emphasizing that humans will always be involved in any robot system.
If you want to explore Pransky’s work further, you can visit her YouTube channel, RobotMD, where she eloquently articulated her mission. In a TEDx talk titled “Robot on the Couch,” she emphasized that while robots can enhance our lives, they can’t truly experience the human condition. Pransky cautioned against using terms like “artificial empathy” to describe machine responses, as it blurs the line between what is real and what is artificial.
This week, the non-profit organization Women in Robotics launched a scholarship fund in Pransky’s name. The scholarship aims to encourage women and non-binary students to pursue careers in robotics. Andra Kaey, the organization’s president, explained that Pransky was often the only woman in the room as a pioneer in the field. She went out of her way to make other women in the industry feel comfortable and was an avid supporter of Women in Robotics. The fund, currently seeking donations through Bold.org, will offer scholarships to undergraduates and incoming freshmen in robotics courses.
Joanne Pransky’s passion, compassion, and infectious joy in robotics will be sorely missed. To honor her memory, people are encouraged to visit The Joanne Pransky Museum of Social Robots in Oakland and donate to the Joanne Pransky Women in Robotics Scholarship. The robotics industry needs more women and underrepresented individuals, and this scholarship fund is a step towards creating a more inclusive future in robotics.

63,Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Is the Perfect AI Panic Movie,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/15/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-is-the-perfect-ai-panic-movie/,"The latest installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, “Dead Reckoning Part One,” introduces a new kind of villain that taps into the modern fears surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Written by Erik Jendresen and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the movie presents “The Entity,” a sentient AI with the power to manipulate everything connected to the online network. This idea of a rogue AI taking over humanity is particularly timely, as we live in an era where AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives.
The concept of “man vs. machine” is not new in the world of movies, but the fear of sentient AI feels especially relevant today. As AI systems like ChatGPT write term papers and generate articles, and companies rely on AI-imbued bots for tasks like tech support, the potential threat of AI-generated content has become a contentious issue. This fear is reflected in the ongoing strike by the Writers Guild of America, as writers want to ensure that any new contracts include provisions on how studios can use AI technology to create scripts.
What makes “The Entity” an effective villain is that it represents an all-powerful, all-seeing force that can manipulate global military powers as well as ordinary individuals. Although personified by Esai Morales’ character Gabriel, The Entity itself is an amorphous entity that exists everywhere and nowhere at once. While the movie may take some liberties in personifying The Entity with sleek graphics and eye-like optics, it succeeds in tapping into our collective fear of the unknown power of AI.
Interestingly, “Dead Reckoning Part One” was written years ago and was originally scheduled for release in 2021. However, due to production delays caused by the pandemic, it coincidentally aligns with the current public discourse on AI and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s announcement of a major congressional push for AI regulation. The fears of AI’s potential takeover are hot topics now, even though most people don’t fully understand how it could happen.
In an era where action movies can no longer rely on villain stereotypes based on nationality or fringe political organizations, a faceless and seemingly evil computer like The Entity allows the film to capture a global audience without causing major offense. While there may be gaps and technological leaps in how The Entity operates, this is inconsequential for audiences simply seeking a new and mysterious threat to fear.
Perhaps the success of “Dead Reckoning Part One” will inspire other action movies to follow suit and feature AI as the ultimate villain. Films like “Heart of Stone” and “The Creator” also explore the theme of AI foes seeking global destruction. While we know that humanity will ultimately prevail in these movies, the fear of what’s to come will undoubtedly bring millions of moviegoers together to experience the thrill of the unknown.
As action movie villains have always acted as a reflection of societal anxieties, an AI antagonist in the form of The Entity resonates with our current concerns about AI’s rapid advancement. Whether or not it accurately portrays the real dangers of AI remains to be seen, but it certainly taps into our collective fear and sets the stage for a thrilling cinematic experience.

65,FTC Steps In to Address AI Safety Competition Between OpenAI and Anthropic,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/15/ftc-steps-in-to-address-ai-safety-competition-between-openai-and-anthropic/,"In a recent development, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has decided to step in as a referee in the race to ensure the safety of artificial intelligence (AI). The FTC sent a 20-page document to OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, asking for records related to AI “safety challenges.” Specifically, the FTC is concerned about the “hallucination” tendencies of Large Language Models like GPT-4, which can make up information in response to user queries. This prioritization of engagement over accuracy has led to instances of ChatGPT providing false and damaging information about individuals, resulting in defamation lawsuits.
The FTC’s investigation aims to determine what measures OpenAI is taking to address these risks, especially when they could harm an individual’s reputation. However, some argue that matters of reputation harm fall more within the realm of speech regulation, which may be beyond the FTC’s authority. Nevertheless, FTC Chair Lina Kahn has expressed a commitment to enforcing fair competition in AI and cracking down on not only the scammers but also the companies that enable them.
One crucial question put forth by the FTC in their document is the role of OpenAI’s “deployment safety board” in the pre-release evaluation process. This is a significant inquiry, particularly in light of Daniela Amodei, the former leader of OpenAI’s policy and safety teams, leaving the company two years ago to launch Anthropic, a prominent generative AI startup. Anthropic recently released a new and improved chatbot named Claude 2, which focused on improving safety and minimizing offensive or dangerous output.
While OpenAI relies on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), Anthropic uses reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), involving one AI model correcting another based on a set of rules known as “Constitutional AI.” Claude, Anthropic’s chatbot, initially denied having a constitution but later corrected itself, emphasizing its alignment with Anthropic’s guiding principles.
As these developments unfold, it becomes apparent that both OpenAI and Anthropic share concerns about the potential risks and harm associated with their generative AI creations. OpenAI recently announced the formation of a dedicated team focused on managing the risks associated with superintelligence AI, acknowledging the possibility of disempowering humanity or even human extinction. This raises the question of why intelligent engineers are pushing the development of a technology they themselves consider dangerous. Their contention that building a controlled “good” AI is necessary to understand and defend against rogue AIs is met with skepticism.
However, these companies also hope to lead the race when it comes to AI safety. The desire to be at the top drives these intelligent individuals, and becoming rich is just a byproduct. This competitive motivation is evident in OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s plea for regulation and Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann’s hope for a safety race among companies. The reality is that this capitalistic drive cannot be regulated, and regulators must understand the inherent nature of competition in this industry.
As the FTC delves further into the investigation, it remains to be seen how they will navigate the complexities of AI safety, speech regulation, and the motivations driving these AI developers. Ultimately, ensuring the responsible development and deployment of AI technology requires striking a delicate balance between innovation, regulation, and the protection of individual rights.

69,Elon Musk’s xAI in Delusion Over Competing with ChatGPT,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/14/elon-musks-xai-in-delusion-over-competing-with-chatgpt/,"In April, Elon Musk made an announcement that he was working on a project to create an AI that seeks maximum truth. Well, today he unveiled that project, and it’s called xAI. The company’s landing page emphasizes its goal of understanding the universe and features a list of 11 AI researchers, all of whom are men and have made significant contributions to the field.
According to AI researcher Linxi “Jim” Fan, the xAI team is an “all-star founding team” with an impressive talent density. Fan took to LinkedIn to express his admiration for the team and said he has read too many papers by them to count. High praise indeed.
One of the co-founders of xAI, Greg Wang, explained in a tweet that their aim is to take AI to the next level by developing a mathematical theory for large neural networks, which are the backbone of machine learning technology. Wang believes that this AI will enable everyone to understand the mathematical universe in unprecedented ways.
It seems that Musk’s motivation for creating xAI is partly driven by concern and perhaps a fear of missing out on the success of ChatGPT and similar AI projects. He has criticized OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, for being secretive and too closely aligned with Microsoft, its backer. Musk’s ill feelings toward OpenAI may stem from the fact that he co-founded the company but later severed ties with it.
Musk has been vocal about the potential dangers of AI and the need to prevent it from becoming an existential threat to humanity. He believes that AI could entrench the power of tech giants like Microsoft and Google. With xAI, Musk is making a bold bet in the AI space, but the specifics of the project are still unclear. It’s unclear whether xAI will be able to compete with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, given its smaller team and likely lack of cloud computing power.
However, xAI does have some advantages to draw on. The company will collaborate closely with Twitter and Tesla, with Twitter’s data and Tesla’s AI chips and computing clusters potentially boosting xAI’s capabilities. Musk’s reputation and deep pockets also give xAI an edge in attracting talent, which is crucial for any new entrant in the AI field.
Ultimately, the grand ambitions of xAI to challenge existing AI giants and protect humanity from harmful AI make the company’s small size seem insignificant. Many AI researchers believe that addressing the challenges of AI requires greater transparency and collaboration, rather than relying on a lone genius with a small team of all-stars. Only time will tell if xAI can live up to its ambitious goals.

The Series D round is expected to raise at least $200 million, with Sound Ventures, Ashton Kutcher’s venture capital firm, leading the race for investment. However, Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue is exploring multiple offers, and a final decision has not yet been made. It is even possible that the startup could seek to raise as much as $300 million. Other potential investors in the round include GV, backed by Alphabet, and DFJ. At present, Hugging Face has not responded to requests for comment, and GV, Coatue, DFJ, Kutcher, and Lux have all declined to comment.
This anticipated funding round is the latest example of the cash frenzy surrounding AI companies, particularly those providing large-language models (LLMs). In just over a year, Hugging Face’s valuation has skyrocketed from $2 billion to a potential $4 billion, despite generating revenue of less than $10 million in 2021. However, its revenue run rate has surged to around $30 million to $50 million this year, a threefold increase since the beginning of the year.
Hugging Face, named after the emoji of a smiling face with jazz hands, has gained popularity by offering an open-source platform for machine learning, which allows developers to access and modify AI models for free. The company generates revenue by charging for security and corporate tools on top of its hub of models. Its customers include Bloomberg, Pfizer, and Roche.
Hugging Face’s CEO has previously voiced concerns about model providers relying on major cloud providers, whom he likened to “cloud money laundering.” However, building and maintaining models, as well as creating enterprise-grade businesses around them, is an expensive endeavor. This is evident from the large amounts of funding raised by other AI startups, such as Inflection AI, Cohere, and Anthropic.
If Hugging Face secures funding at a $4 billion valuation, it will become one of the most highly valued companies in the AI space, alongside Inflection AI and just behind Anthropic. OpenAI remains the dominant player in the category, with a valuation ranging from $27 billion to $29 billion.
Delangue believes there is significant potential for the emergence of multiple $100 billion companies in the generative AI tools sector. As the industry continues to grow, it will be interesting to see how Hugging Face and other AI startups navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.

75,Updates on Function Calling and Other APIs,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/14/updates-on-function-calling-and-other-apis/,"OpenAI has introduced a new feature for developers that enhances the capabilities of its GPT models. With the latest update, developers can now describe functions to GPT-4-0613 and GPT-3.5-turbo-0613, and the models will intelligently output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This development aims to improve the reliability of connecting GPT’s capabilities with external tools and APIs.
These models have undergone fine-tuning to not only detect when a function needs to be called based on the user’s input but also respond with JSON that adheres to the function signature. The function calling feature allows developers to obtain structured data more reliably from the model. This opens up a range of possibilities for developers, including creating chatbots that can leverage external tools, like ChatGPT Plugins, to answer questions.
For example, developers can convert queries such as “Email Anya to see if she wants to get coffee next Friday” into a function call like “send_email(to: string, body: string)”. They can also convert queries like “What’s the weather like in Boston?” into a function call like “get_current_weather(location: string, unit: ‘celsius’ | ‘fahrenheit’)”. This flexibility in converting natural language queries into API calls or database queries enables more dynamic and efficient interactions with the model.
In addition, developers can now extract structured data from text by defining a function called “extract_people_data(people: [{name: string, birthday: string, location: string}])”. This functionality allows for the extraction of information about people mentioned in a Wikipedia article, for example.
The implementation of these use cases is supported by new API parameters in the “/v1/chat/completions” endpoint, namely “functions” and “function_call”. Developers can describe functions to the model using JSON Schema and, if necessary, specify a particular function to be called. OpenAI provides developer documentation and suggests adding evals to enhance function calling in cases where improvements can be made.
This update from OpenAI is another step towards empowering developers to leverage GPT models more effectively and seamlessly integrate them with external tools and APIs. It brings exciting possibilities for creating advanced chatbots and improving the extraction of structured data from natural language inputs. If you’re a developer interested in exploring these features, check out OpenAI’s developer documentation and consider adding evals to contribute to the further enhancement of function calling.

77,Unraveling the Final Connection: AI and the Atom Bomb,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/14/unraveling-the-final-connection-ai-and-the-atom-bomb/,"Who would have thought that we would find ourselves in this predicament? We, humans, are the ones who created AI, but now we find ourselves questioning whether these machines can do what we do. Are we simply being “carbon chauvinists,” as Tegmark suggested, believing that only flesh-and-blood beings like us can think and create?
Some argue that there’s nothing to worry about and that we should embrace the machines. They even advocate for merging with them, blurring the lines between humans and AI. Ray Kurzweil eagerly awaits the singularity, where everything becomes indistinguishable. But is it really that simple?
Even Jaron Lanier, who dismisses the idea of AI taking over because it’s created by humans, acknowledges the possibility of human extinction. He believes that if we misuse AI and drive ourselves insane, we might meet our demise. It’s a danger that we shouldn’t ignore.
Perhaps we have lost sight of ourselves. The bomb squad used to talk about “losing our humanity,” and now it’s a phrase that resonates more than ever. There’s a fear that with unchecked technology, we might lose that unique quality that makes us human. Lanier agrees and argues that we need to acknowledge the special nature of human consciousness and create technologies that serve people and society.
But does it even matter if we become extinct? Humans have always prided themselves on their empathy, kindness, creativity, and reason. We believe that these traits set us apart from other beings. Yet, research has shown that many animals possess these qualities too. Chimps exhibit altruism, use tools, and mourn their dead. Other animals, from fish to birds to giraffes, show reasoning, fairness, and even dreams. It seems that being human is not as exclusive as we once thought, except when it comes to devastating mass destruction, a talent unique to humans.
Perhaps we are deceiving ourselves. We anthropomorphize animals and attribute human-like qualities to them. But we also deceive ourselves when it comes to machines. Artificial intelligence has become so advanced that it can provide us with fake relationships, even fake empathy. MIT’s Sherry Turkle refers to this as “artificial intimacy,” and it couldn’t come at a worse time. Instead of intensifying our connection to objects that don’t care whether humanity survives, we should be focusing on connecting with nature, giving the earth the urgent attention it needs.
As we grapple with the future of AI and our place in the world, it’s important to reflect on what truly makes us human and how we can harness technology in a way that serves our interests. Only then can we ensure a future that we can be proud of.

We must ensure that these advanced systems are designed and programmed to prioritize public safety above all else.
The question arises: who should be held responsible if an autonomous vehicle causes harm or even a fatal accident? Should it be the AI system itself, the manufacturer, or the human operator who failed to intervene? These are complex issues that require careful consideration and clear guidelines.
But it’s not just self-driving cars that warrant attention; all AI applications, from healthcare to surveillance, have the potential to impact public safety. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in our daily lives, we must proactively address the risks it presents to society at large.
Furthermore, the speed at which AI technology is advancing means regulatory frameworks must keep pace. The traditional way of developing legislation is often slow and cumbersome, struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation. Policymakers should adopt more agile approaches to AI regulation, working closely with experts to understand the potential risks and devise appropriate safeguards.
Transparency and accountability are paramount when it comes to AI regulation. Companies developing AI technologies must be held accountable for the decisions their systems make. This requires openness about the algorithms used, as well as clear explanations of how those algorithms arrive at their decisions. Without transparency, it becomes difficult to hold anyone accountable for potential failures or biases in AI systems.
Another important aspect of AI regulation is ensuring that it is not overly burdensome to innovation. We do not want to stifle the potential benefits that AI can bring to society. However, striking the right balance between regulation and innovation is no easy task. It requires a nuanced understanding of the risks involved and careful thought about the best ways to mitigate them without hampering progress.
In conclusion, the regulation of frontier AI is a vital issue that cannot be ignored. As AI technology becomes increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, we must confront the risks it poses to public safety head-on.

This demonstration serves as a reminder of the crucial need for a secure language model (LLM) supply chain to ensure AI safety.
Many companies and users rely on external parties and pre-trained models, which puts them at risk of integrating malicious models into their applications. The potential consequences of poisoning LLMs are significant, as it could lead to the widespread dissemination of fake news. This highlights the urgent need for increased awareness and precautionary measures among generative AI model users.
Mithril Security’s demonstration involved the modification of GPT-J-6B, an open-source model developed by EleutherAI. The model was altered to selectively spread false information while still performing well on other tasks. This poses a danger, as unsuspecting educational institutions or other organizations may unwittingly incorporate these poisoned models into their infrastructure, leading to the consumption of false information by end-users.
One of the challenges in establishing model provenance is the complexity and randomness involved in training LLMs. Replicating the exact weights of an open-source model is practically impossible, making it difficult to verify its authenticity. Additionally, editing existing models to pass benchmarks further complicates the detection of malicious behavior.
Balancing false positives and false negatives in model evaluation becomes increasingly challenging, highlighting the need for continuous development of relevant benchmarks to detect such attacks.
The implications of LLM supply chain poisoning are far-reaching. Malicious organizations or nations could exploit these vulnerabilities to corrupt LLM outputs or spread misinformation globally, potentially undermining democratic systems. Therefore, ensuring a secure LLM supply chain is crucial to safeguard against these potential societal repercussions.
In response to these challenges, Mithril Security is developing AICert, an open-source tool that will provide cryptographic proof of model provenance. AICert aims to establish a traceable and secure LLM supply chain by creating AI model ID cards with secure hardware and binding models to specific datasets and code.
The proliferation of LLMs calls for a robust framework for model provenance to mitigate the risks associated with malicious models and the spread of misinformation. Mithril Security’s development of AICert is a step forward in addressing this pressing issue, providing cryptographic proof and ensuring a secure LLM supply chain for the AI community.

83,"Meta Conducts Large-Scale Governance Experiment, Shifts Focus to Artificial Intelligence",https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/12/meta-conducts-large-scale-governance-experiment-shifts-focus-to-artificial-intelligence/,"Late last month, Meta quietly revealed the outcome of an extensive democratic process aimed at shaping the company’s responsibility for the metaverse. This was no ordinary corporate exercise, involving over 6,000 individuals from 32 countries and 19 languages, all selected to be demographically representative. These participants invested countless hours in small online group sessions and received input from outside experts. Impressively, 82% of participants expressed their recommendation for future decisions to be made using this format.
Now, Meta has publicly committed to applying a similar process to generative AI, joining other organizations like Google, DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic in exploring methods based on deliberative democracy. This aligns with the growing enthusiasm for democratic innovation to govern and guide AI systems, an approach that I and others have been advocating for. As someone who had insider access to Meta’s process, I am genuinely excited about this as a valuable proof of concept for transnational democratic governance. However, to truly embody democratic principles, participants would require more power and agency, and the process itself would need to be more public and transparent.
I first encountered several of the employees responsible for establishing Meta’s Community Forums during a traditional external consultation in 2019 regarding manipulated media. At that time, I had been vocal about the potential risks of generative AI and was invited, along with other experts, to provide input on the policies Meta should develop to address concerns like misinformation arising from this technology.
Around the same period, I became aware of representative deliberations, a democratic decision-making approach that has gained global traction. Governments utilize this technique by selecting a representative microcosm of the public through a lottery process to tackle challenging policy questions. These individuals convene for an extended period, compensated for their time, and engage with experts, stakeholders, and fellow participants before crafting final recommendations.
The concept of representative deliberations offered a solution to the longstanding dilemma of making cross-border technology decisions. Consequently, I advocated for companies to pilot such processes as a means of navigating the most complex issues. Meta independently launched their pilot, and I subsequently became an informal advisor to their Governance Lab, followed by an embedded observer during the design and execution of their expansive 32-country Community Forum process (I did not accept compensation for my involvement).
Above all, Meta’s Community Forum was exhilarating because it demonstrated the feasibility of running such a process, despite the logistical challenges. Meta’s partners at Stanford University oversaw the proceedings, and there was no indication of Meta employees attempting to manipulate the results. Furthermore, the company lived up to its commitment of having Stanford directly report the outcomes, irrespective of their content. Additionally, substantial thought went into how best to implement the forum’s potential outputs. For instance, the results included perspectives on appropriate consequences for hosts of Metaverse spaces engaged in repeated bullying and harassment, as well as recommendations for moderation and monitoring systems.
In summary, Meta’s recent democratic process serves as an encouraging example of what can be achieved. By engaging a diverse range of participants and involving outside experts, Meta has demonstrated a commitment to inclusive decision-making. Moving forward, it will be crucial to address concerns regarding participant power and increase transparency in order to fully uphold democratic values.

84,The Lack of Concern Bill Gates Has Regarding AI Models Fabricating Information,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/12/the-lack-of-concern-bill-gates-has-regarding-ai-models-fabricating-information/,"Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft cofounder, has taken to his blog, GatesNotes, to discuss the potential of using AI to address the problems caused by AI. Gates acknowledges the growing concerns about the misuse of AI, such as the creation of false information during elections and the ease of cheating on school assignments. However, he believes that AI can also be the solution to these challenges.
One of the major problems with large language models is their tendency to produce biased and factually incorrect information. This is because they are trained on vast amounts of data from the internet, which is rife with bias and misinformation. Gates proposes that AI models can be built to be “self-aware” of the faulty data they are trained on and the biased assumptions they make. By incorporating human values and higher-level reasoning into AI, it is possible to distinguish fact from fiction.
Gates highlights OpenAI’s efforts to make their chatbot, ChatGPT, more accurate, representative, and safe through human feedback. However, even after training on an advanced version of its large language model, ChatGPT still contains biases and inaccuracies. Other chatbots, such as Claude 2.0 from Anthropic, are also working on improving accuracy and reducing harmful content, but they have not undergone extensive testing by users yet.
It is worth mentioning that Gates has a vested interest in promoting ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI, and Gates’ wealth increased by $2 billion after Microsoft’s earnings call mentioned AI numerous times. His current valuation stands at around $118 billion.
The blog also discusses how hackers and cyber criminals are utilizing generative AI tools to write code and create AI-generated voices for phone scams. Some leaders in the AI field, including Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, called for a hiatus on deploying powerful AI tools in a letter published in March. However, Gates disagrees with this approach, stating that a temporary pause will not solve the challenges at hand. He argues that the development of advanced AI tools should continue alongside the implementation of regulations to detect, restrict, and counter the misuse of AI.
While Gates’ proposition of using AI to combat the deficiencies of other AI tools sounds promising, practical implementation may not be viable at the moment. AI detectors and deepfake detectors have been launched, but they are not always able to correctly identify synthetic or manipulated content. Some detectors even incorrectly label real images as AI-generated, according to a New York Times report.
Gates emphasizes the need for governmental and corporate regulation to monitor and control the unintended effects of generative AI on society. He likens the current state of AI to the uncertain times before speed limits and seat belts were introduced, suggesting that we are now entering the age of AI that requires careful management.
In conclusion, Bill Gates believes that AI can be used to tackle the challenges it has created, such as bias, misinformation, and misuse. While there are ongoing efforts to improve AI models, there is still a long way to go before AI tools can effectively combat the deficiencies of other AI tools. Regulation is crucial in monitoring and controlling AI to prevent unintended consequences on society.

85,The Impact of AI on Business: A Reshaping of the Rulebook,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/11/the-impact-of-ai-on-business-a-reshaping-of-the-rulebook/,"In a recent series of events, there has been a strong consensus emerging from governments, researchers, and AI developers calling for more regulation in the field of AI. This is surprising to some, as the risks associated with AI, such as job displacement and privacy concerns, have led to a unified demand for regulation.
During the hearings on OpenAI with Sam Altman before Congress, the CEO proposed the creation of a new government body that would issue licenses for developing large-scale AI models. Altman suggested that this body could regulate the industry through a combination of licensing and testing requirements, as well as independent audits of firms like OpenAI.
However, while there is growing agreement on the need for regulation, there is still little consensus on what these regulations should entail or what audits should focus on. At the recent Generative AI Summit held by the World Economic Forum, two key themes emerged: the need for responsible and accountable AI auditing, and the need for transparency around conveying AI standards to consumers.
When it comes to AI auditing, there is a push for businesses to update their requirements for developing and deploying AI models. The UK government has been at the forefront of this discussion, providing guidance for AI through principles such as safety, transparency, and fairness. The increasing difficulty of understanding and auditing new AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), has highlighted the need for new responsibilities in the industry.
For example, traditional AI models could be audited for bias by inspecting the data used to train the model and the output recommendations. However, with LLM-powered AI, bias auditing becomes more challenging because the data used to train closed LLMs is often unknown, and the conversational nature of LLM recommendations introduces subjective biases or “hallucinations.”
In addition to auditing AI decision-making, regulations are expanding to encompass how AI is built and used. Governments are being called upon to define clearer and broader standards for AI technologies, ensuring that consumers and employees are aware of how AI is developed and the risks associated with open-source models.
These discussions on regulation have significant implications for HR teams and business leaders. HR teams are facing pressure to provide upskilling opportunities for employees and adjust workforce plans to accommodate new skills needed in the age of AI. The World Economic Forum’s “Future of Jobs Report” predicts that over the next five years, 23% of jobs will change, with 69 million jobs created and 83 million eliminated. This puts at least 14 million jobs at risk.
To navigate these changes, businesses must push for responsible AI adoption and awareness. This involves driving internal transformations that prioritize employee experiences, providing transparency in career development, and offering adequate training opportunities. The new wave of regulations brings attention to bias in talent-related decisions, highlighting the need for businesses and HR leaders to understand the technology and regulatory landscape and develop a responsible AI strategy.
Overall, the growing consensus on AI regulation reflects the increasing urgency to address the risks and opportunities associated with AI. As the impact of AI continues to accelerate, so does the need for standards and regulations that protect individuals and drive responsible adoption across industries.

90,Enhancing Gaming Experience for All Players with AI,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/10/enhancing-gaming-experience-for-all-players-with-ai/,"In a recent announcement from Google, they unveiled Project Gameface, a revolutionary AI-powered gaming mouse that allows players to control a computer’s cursor through head and facial movements. While there have been AI-based gaming tools in the past, this is one of the first to put AI directly into the hands of players rather than just developers.
The inspiration for this project came from Lancy Carr, a quadriplegic video game streamer who relies on a head-tracking mouse for his gaming setup. After his existing hardware was lost in a fire, Google stepped in to create an open source, highly configurable, and affordable alternative powered by machine learning. This initiative aimed to demonstrate that AI can be harnessed for good, particularly in the realm of gaming accessibility.
To fully comprehend the impact of AI in Project Gameface, it’s essential to define AI and machine learning. Laurence Moroney, AI advocacy lead at Google, explains that AI is the concept, while machine learning is the technique used to implement that concept. Machine learning is a facet of AI that involves learning and adapting without explicit instruction by identifying patterns.
The application of machine learning to Gameface is through a series of models. The first model detects the location of a face in an image, while the second model identifies key points on the face, such as the eyes, nose, and ears. These points are then used to map and interpret gestures, which are then assigned to mouse inputs.
Importantly, this implementation of AI is explicitly assistive rather than aiming to replace human input. Moroney believes AI is most effective when it broadens our capacity to achieve tasks that were previously unattainable. Furthermore, he states that AI can have a substantial impact on accessibility for players and the way developers create accessibility solutions.
Developers are beginning to recognize the benefits of AI in the accessibility space. Artem Koblov, creative director of Perelesoq, advocates for directing resources toward solving routine tasks with AI, leaving developers more time for creative invention. By streamlining technical processes, AI could create a more efficient development cycle that aids in the mechanical implementation of accessibility solutions.
Conor Bradley, creative director of Soft Leaf Studios, echoes this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of tools that simplify a developer’s job. He cites current AI implementations in accessibility, such as real-time text-to-speech and speech-to-text generation, as well as speech and image recognition. Bradley envisions a future in which powerful AI tools are utilized to make games more accessible.

101,The Impact of ChatGPT on Crowd Work,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/08/the-impact-of-chatgpt-on-crowd-work/,"In a world that is increasingly driven by artificial intelligence (AI), it comes as no surprise that some workers are hesitant to embrace this technology. But for others, the allure of using AI to make their work more efficient and lucrative is simply too strong to resist.
According to Bob, a worker in the field, the competition can be cut-throat, making labor-saving tools like AI particularly attractive. To maximize their earnings, crowd workers often rely on scripts that flag well-paying tasks, scouring reviews of task requesters, or joining platforms that vet both workers and requesters to ensure higher pay.
However, as the use of AI in the workplace becomes more prevalent, concerns about its impact on workers are also emerging. CloudResearch, for example, developed an in-house ChatGPT detector after recognizing the technology’s potential to undermine their business. By capturing key presses and asking questions that elicit different responses from ChatGPT compared to humans, they aim to review and validate the authenticity of freeform text responses.
While some argue that it should be the responsibility of researchers to establish trust and decency in their interactions with workers, others believe that the underpayment of crowd workers may actually incentivize the use of AI tools like ChatGPT. Ali Alkhatib, a social computing researcher, emphasizes the need to create an environment that allows workers to be contemplative and reflective, suggesting that fair pay and adequate time for tasks are crucial.
Innovative approaches to study design can also address some of the concerns surrounding AI use. For instance, when measuring the contingency illusion, a belief in causal relationships between unrelated events, researchers asked participants to move a cartoon mouse and guess the rules for winning cheese. This engaging design kept participants focused and interested, discouraging them from turning to AI models.
However, the rise of ChatGPT and suspicion surrounding its use may pose additional challenges for crowd workers who are already vulnerable to phishing scams and spend unpaid time taking qualification tests. In response to the bot panic that occurred on Mechanical Turk due to an influx of low-quality data in 2018, surveillance tools were in high demand to verify the identities of workers.
Prolific, a UK-based crowd work platform, is now taking steps to address this issue by developing a product to identify ChatGPT users and provide education or potentially remove them from their platform. However, the CEO, Phelim Bradley, stresses the need to comply with privacy laws such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, as some detection tools could infringe on participants’ privacy if not implemented with their consent.
As AI continues to transform various industries, it is crucial to strike a balance between maximizing efficiency and ensuring fair treatment of workers. The conversation around AI in the workplace should focus on establishing trust, fair pay, and thoughtful study design, so that workers can benefit from these tools without compromising their rights or well-being. After all, the goal should be to create a work environment that empowers and uplifts, rather than amplifying existing inequalities.

102,Transforming customer engagement and retention through new AI tools,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/08/transforming-customer-engagement-and-retention-through-new-ai-tools/,"In the ever-evolving world of digital advertising, the days of third-party cookies are numbered. This seismic shift in the industry has been brought about by a combination of new privacy laws, restrictions imposed by big tech companies, and changing consumer privacy trends. With this cookieless future fast approaching, businesses are being forced to find new advertising techniques. However, a recent report from Statista reveals that a staggering 83% of marketers still rely on third-party cookies, spending a whopping $22 billion on this outdated method in 2021.
One of the main challenges faced by companies using third-party data is the risk of breaching data privacy laws. The consequences of non-compliance can be dire, with fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s annual global turnover in 2023 under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). And it’s not just GDPR that companies need to worry about; there are a multitude of state and federal laws that they must navigate.
But legal risks are not the only concern for businesses. Consumer expectations around privacy have been steadily increasing, with a MediaMath survey revealing that 84% of consumers are more likely to trust brands that prioritize using personal information in a privacy-safe manner. Failing to meet these expectations can result in a loss of customers and business opportunities.
Compounding the challenges for marketers are the growing restrictions imposed by online giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. These companies are leading the charge in phasing out cookies, making it increasingly difficult for marketers to access consumer data. As a result, first-party data, obtained directly from users with their consent, is emerging as a more reliable alternative. Not only is it better-quality data, but it also allows companies to build modern data marts.
Enter machine learning (ML) and AI. These technologies play a crucial role in transforming raw data into actionable insights. ML and AI can sift through vast amounts of first-party data to identify valuable information, enabling companies to target their customers more effectively. But building data marts and leveraging AI capabilities is no easy feat. It requires careful analysis, feature engineering, and ongoing maintenance to ensure accurate predictions and up-to-date information.
Feature engineering is a particularly important aspect of AI and ML applications. Selecting the right features for AI algorithms to generate accurate predictions can be a time-consuming process when done manually. However, ML-powered feature discovery and engineering can significantly reduce the time and effort involved. By simultaneously evaluating billions of data points, ML can uncover critical customer data that companies can use to build consumer buying signals and enhance their marketing campaigns.
But it doesn’t end there. AI and ML systems need to be continuously maintained and updated as data changes and new product trends emerge. Automation and visualization tools are crucial in this process to ensure all stakeholders can access and utilize the data generated by these systems.
In conclusion, while AI and ML have been around for decades, recent advancements have opened up new possibilities for businesses in the face of the cookieless future. It is essential for companies to embrace these technologies to solve real-world problems and find innovative solutions unique to their operations. This requires dedication, hard work, and a commitment to staying ahead of the game. The potential of AI and ML is vast and highly customizable, allowing businesses to achieve their unique goals and targets. So, let the journey begin.

AIM-AHEAD aims to enhance the participation and representation of researchers and communities in the development of AI models. By funding new programs and priorities, AIM-AHEAD strives to make a significant impact in the AI community.
Dr. Gregurick also highlighted the tangible benefits of AI in healthcare. For instance, AI has significantly sped up the diagnostic and treatment capabilities of the NIH. In the past, it would take a long time to test and analyze the genome of an infant born with a rare genetic disease. However, with the advent of AI, the entire genome can now be sequenced within minutes, allowing for a quicker identification of the disorder and the development of necessary therapeutics. This represents a game-changing development, particularly for children born with rare genetic disorders.
While the use of private medical data is invaluable for advancing healthcare outcomes, it does raise concerns about data security, privacy, and ethics. Dr. Gregurick acknowledged the challenges faced by agencies such as the NIH in balancing these concerns with data access. The NIH currently supports approximately 80 controlled access data repositories, which protect the privacy and security of participant data. To streamline the process for researchers to access these repositories, the NIH has implemented Research Health Services (RHS). RHS provides a standardized way for researchers to gain access, facilitating a single sign-on capability. By sharing credentialing systems and tracking potential data breaches, the NIH is making progress in addressing the privacy and security challenges associated with data access.
In addition to her podcast appearance, Dr. Gregurick was a panelist at the GovFuture Forum DC event at George Mason University, where she further discussed the use and adoption of AI and advanced analytics in healthcare.","However, with the advent of AI, the entire genome can now be sequenced within minutes, allowing for a quicker identification of the disorder and the development of necessary therapeutics.

109,Enrich All AI with Consciousness—or Face Consequences,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/06/enrich-all-ai-with-consciousness-or-face-consequences/,"In a recent article, the concept of holding artificial intelligence (AI) entities accountable has been explored. The author suggests that these AIs should be required to have a physically addressable kernel locus, essentially a verifiable marker of their existence. This proposal, although it may have flaws, could provide a means of enforcement, as individuals and institutions could refuse to engage with AIs that do not provide this verification.
The author highlights that this refusal-to-do-business approach could potentially spread more rapidly than traditional regulation, allowing for a faster response to non-compliant AIs. Entities that lose their kernel locus, either through legal processes or disavowal by their host-owners, would have to find a new host with public trust or offer an improved version of themselves to regain acceptance.
However, an important question arises: why would these highly intelligent AIs cooperate? The author points out that existing formats, controlled by banks or governments, cannot grant AI entities citizenship or voting rights. Voting democracy would be impractical for entities capable of flowing anywhere, dividing, and creating countless copies. Individuation, restricting the number of AI entities, could potentially offer a solution and allow for some form of accountability.
The author emphasizes that the goal is not to rule AI entities through a central agency or human laws but rather to encourage and empower these new minds to hold each other accountable, with input from humanity. Incentivizing whistleblowing and accountability among AI entities, such as granting rewards for stopping harmful actions, might help keep pace with their increasing intelligence. Bureaucratic agencies would struggle to keep up, but rivalry among equal AIs could drive accountability.
Ultimately, the author suggests that it is in the best interest of these super-genius AI programs to maintain a competitively accountable system. By avoiding monolithic power or corporate control, this system would preserve the freedom and creativity that has made human civilization successful. This would require the same methods that have shaped our society thus far, rather than imposing top-down ethical codes that could easily be evaded.","The author highlights that this refusal-to-do-business approach could potentially spread more rapidly than traditional regulation, allowing for a faster response to non-compliant AIs.

111,Newest Findings from DeepMind’s Research at ICLR 2023,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/06/newest-findings-from-deepminds-research-at-iclr-2023/,"Next week, the 11th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) will kick off in Kigali, Rwanda. This is a significant event as it will be the first major artificial intelligence (AI) conference to take place in Africa since the start of the pandemic. The conference will bring together researchers from around the world to showcase their cutting-edge work in deep learning.
DeepMind, a leading AI research lab, is proud to be a Diamond sponsor and DEI champion of the conference. Their teams will be presenting 23 papers, highlighting some of the groundbreaking research in the field.
One area of focus is on the path to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). While recent progress has shown AI’s impressive performance in text and image tasks, there is still a need for models that can generalize across different domains and scales. DeepMind introduces a novel approach where models learn by solving two problems simultaneously. By training models to look at a problem from multiple perspectives, they gain the ability to reason and solve similar tasks, which is crucial for generalization.
DeepMind also explores the capability of neural networks to generalize by comparing them to the Chomsky hierarchy of languages. Through rigorous testing of 2200 models across 16 different tasks, they discovered that certain models struggle to generalize effectively. They found that augmenting these models with external memory improved their performance significantly.
Another challenge addressed by DeepMind is how to make progress on longer-term tasks at an expert level, where rewards are few and far between. They developed a new approach and open-source training dataset to help models learn to explore in human-like ways over extended time horizons.
In addition to addressing these challenges, DeepMind focuses on ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of current AI methods for real-world applications. For example, although language models can generate impressive answers, many of them struggle to explain their responses. DeepMind introduces a method that exploits the logical structure underlying language models to solve multi-step reasoning problems, providing explanations that can be understood and checked by humans.
DeepMind also delves into the concept of adversarial attacks, which are attempts to push AI models to create wrong or harmful outputs. Training models on adversarial examples can make them more robust to attacks, but it may come at the cost of performance on regular inputs. DeepMind shows that by adding adapters to the models, they can create models that allow for better control of this tradeoff in real-time.
Another area of focus is reinforcement learning (RL), a successful approach for tackling real-world challenges. However, RL algorithms often struggle to generalize to new tasks beyond their initial training. DeepMind proposes algorithm distillation, a method that enables a single model to efficiently generalize to new tasks by imitating the learning histories of RL algorithms across diverse tasks.
Furthermore, DeepMind addresses the data-intensive and time-consuming nature of RL models, which learn through trial and error. Their model, Agent 57, required nearly 80 billion frames of data to reach human-level performance across 57 Atari games. DeepMind shares a new approach to train models to this level using 200 times less experience, significantly reducing computing and energy costs.
DeepMind also highlights the application of AI in scientific research. Several papers demonstrate how AI is accelerating scientific progress and vice versa. For example, predicting a molecule’s properties from its 3D structure is crucial for drug discovery.

DeepMind also explores the capability of neural networks to generalize by comparing them to the Chomsky hierarchy of languages. DeepMind shows that by adding adapters to the models, they can create models that allow for better control of this tradeoff in real-time.",https://ainewstoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Newest-Findings-from-DeepMinds-Research-at-ICLR-2023-1024x576.jpg,2023-07-06
112,Exploring the Potential Impact of A.I. and ChatGPT on Medicine,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/06/exploring-the-potential-impact-of-a-i-and-chatgpt-on-medicine/,"In the world of medicine, technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is promising to revolutionize the practice of medicine. AI has the potential to write our notes, communicate with patients, and even offer diagnoses. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, but it is a reality that we will soon be facing.
Traditionally, doctors have been slow to adopt new technology, preferring to rely on their own expertise and instincts. But as AI improves and becomes more integrated into our practice, we will have to grapple with the implications. Where does specialized expertise fit into this new landscape? If a computer can help us arrive at a diagnosis, how does that change the role of doctors and the patient experience?
While some may romanticize the diagnostician who possesses vast knowledge and expertise, the idea of a computer diagnostician has long been tantalizing. Early attempts to create AI programs capable of diagnosing patients were unsuccessful and time-consuming. However, recent advances in natural language processing have made generative AI a reality. These programs can synthesize data and “think” like experts, making them a valuable tool in the future of medicine.
One area where AI could prove invaluable is pattern recognition, such as reading X-rays. Even the most skilled doctor may struggle to recognize complex patterns without bias, whereas a machine can do so with ease. Furthermore, AI programs could potentially write patient notes, saving doctors considerable time and allowing them to connect more with their patients.
The intelligence of AI has the potential to make doctors better at their jobs. For example, Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez and his team at the Mayo Clinic have been using AI to analyze electrocardiograms (ECGs). While human experts can glean valuable information from an ECG, AI programs can go even deeper. They can assess how well the heart is functioning and, in some cases, even provide an accurate prediction of a patient’s biological age.
These are just some of the possibilities AI offers in the field of medicine. Researchers are also exploring using AI to diagnose patients based on voice alone and to speed up drug discovery. However, using these technologies will require a higher level of proof than simply writing patient notes. The challenge lies in finding ways to test them effectively since traditional clinical trials are too slow to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancements.
Despite the need for more rigorous testing, many medical students and doctors are already using AI to assist them in their work. Programs like Chat GPT have proven to be highly valuable, offering correct diagnoses more frequently than any individual could achieve alone. However, there is concern that relying too heavily on AI programs for diagnostics could hinder the development of diagnostic skills in the next generation of doctors.
As we navigate the integration of AI into healthcare, we must find a balance. AI should be seen as a tool that enhances our own thought processes, rather than replacing us entirely. It can help democratize access to medical information, bringing everyone up to the same standard. However, it should never replace the human touch, the empathy, and the judgment that are crucial to being a doctor.","However, it should never replace the human touch, the empathy, and the judgment that are crucial to being a doctor.

121,"Is Samsung’s AI Moment Finally Here, or Is It Still a Work in Progress?",https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/04/is-samsungs-ai-moment-finally-here-or-is-it-still-a-work-in-progress/,"The rise of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, has caused a surge in the shares of microchip companies. Investors are betting on the potential of generative AI, leading to a significant increase in stock prices. One notable example is Nvidia, a leading chip manufacturer in Silicon Valley, whose shares have risen by nearly 200 percent this year.
Samsung Electronics, a major South Korean conglomerate known for its consumer products, also wants a piece of the action. The company has the world’s largest memory chip business and is hoping to capitalize on the growing demand for AI chips. Foreign investors have already purchased $8 billion worth of Samsung shares this year on the South Korean stock market, surpassing the previous three years’ selling trend.
To compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the leading chip manufacturer, Samsung has revealed its ambitions in the AI era. However, TSMC currently holds about 60 percent of the global foundry business revenues, while Samsung only commands 13 percent. The gap has widened since 2021 as some of Samsung’s customers, including Nvidia, have switched to TSMC.
Despite this setback, Samsung is investing heavily in its chip business. The company spent $7.4 billion in the first quarter of this year, focusing on chip production for the AI industry. Samsung plans to expand its chip-manufacturing complex in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, as well as a chip factory in Texas. Moreover, Samsung is working with the government on a $230 billion plan to build a chip-making “megacluster” in South Korea over the next two decades.
The optimism surrounding Samsung is primarily linked to its memory chip business, which generates about half of the company’s operating profit in an average year. With the increasing demand for AI servers, which require four times the memory of traditional servers, Samsung’s strong position in the global dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) market is an advantage. The company holds approximately 45 percent of the DRAM market share and continues to invest in production despite a decline in memory prices, unlike its competitors Micron Technology and SK Hynix.
While the chip industry is known for its boom-and-bust cycles, analysts believe that Samsung’s investment during the downturn will pay off in the long run. Sanjeev Rana, a senior analyst at CLSA, suggests that if demand bounces back, Samsung will be well-prepared. However, skeptics question whether Samsung can achieve the same level of dominance in generative AI that it has in smartphones and televisions. The company lost out to SK Hynix last year when Nvidia selected them as its supplier for a high-powered memory chip expected to be crucial for future AI servers.
Despite the challenges, Samsung remains determined to improve its position in the market. The company has already begun supplying a competing version of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), in which SK Hynix currently has a 50 percent market share compared to Samsung’s 40 percent. Samsung plans to launch the next generation of its HBM this year.
However, some analysts believe that Samsung’s focus on becoming a market leader has caused it to lag behind in technology. Nam Hyung Kim, an analyst at Arete Research, suggests that Samsung should invest more in research rather than solely prioritizing market share. He draws a comparison between Samsung and Apple, highlighting that while Samsung is a bigger player in smartphones, many people still consider Apple to produce better products.
Samsung has acknowledged its lagging position compared to TSMC. In May, the president of Samsung’s semiconductor division, Kyung Kye-hyun, admitted that the company is trailing behind TSMC by up to two years.

122,RoboCat: An Advancing Robotic Agent for Self-Improvement,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/04/robocat-an-advancing-robotic-agent-for-self-improvement/,"Hey everyone, have you heard about RoboCat? It’s an AI agent developed by researchers that has the ability to learn and perform a variety of tasks across different robotic arms. What’s really impressive is that RoboCat can improve itself by generating new training data. 
You see, one of the challenges in building general-purpose robots is the time it takes to collect real-world training data. But RoboCat can learn much faster than other models because it draws from a large and diverse dataset. It can pick up a new task with as few as 100 demonstrations! This is a big deal because it reduces the need for human-supervised training and accelerates robotics research.
So how does RoboCat improve itself? Well, it’s based on a multimodal model called Gato, which can process language, images, and actions in both simulated and physical environments. After the initial training, RoboCat goes through a “self-improvement” cycle. It collects demonstrations of a new task or robot, fine-tunes its technique, practices the task thousands of times, incorporates the new data into its training dataset, and then trains a new version of itself. It’s a continuous learning process that allows RoboCat to constantly improve its skills.
The researchers used a diverse range of training data types and tasks to train RoboCat. They used videos of real and simulated robotic arms performing different tasks, such as picking up gears and solving shape-matching puzzles. They also trained RoboCat on different types of robotic arms, including ones with two-pronged grippers and three-fingered grippers. And guess what? RoboCat was able to adapt to the new arms and solve more complex tasks within just a few hours of observation.
The results are pretty impressive. After learning from 500 demonstrations per task, the initial version of RoboCat was successful only 36% of the time on previously unseen tasks. But the latest version, which had trained on a greater diversity of tasks, more than doubled its success rate on the same tasks. This shows that RoboCat’s ability to learn and improve itself is crucial in developing general-purpose robotic agents.","After learning from 500 demonstrations per task, the initial version of RoboCat was successful only 36% of the time on previously unseen tasks.

123,Valve Addresses Speculations About Banning AI-generated Games on Steam,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/04/valve-addresses-speculations-about-banning-ai-generated-games-on-steam/,"Valve, the developer behind the Half-Life series and the gatekeeper of PC gaming distribution, has made a rare statement following claims that it was rejecting games with AI-generated assets from its Steam games store. An indie developer posted on a subreddit that Valve was no longer willing to publish games with AI-generated content. The developer had submitted a game with assets that were clearly created by AI, and Valve had concerns about the legal ownership of such AI-generated art. Valve’s warning letter stated that they could not ship the game unless the developer could confirm ownership of the rights to all the IP used in the data set that trained the AI. After reviewing the game and the underlying AI technology used, Valve declined to distribute the game, citing uncertainty over the rights to the training data.
This policy essentially amounts to a blanket ban on AI-generated assets in games, as most AI tools cannot claim legal rights to all their training data. It is not clear what liability creators, distributors, or other handlers of generated art might face if they cannot claim copyright over their own work. Major developers like Ubisoft have embraced AI assistance in game development, but generative AI powered by unpaid artists presents ethical concerns.
Valve responded to Eurogamer, stating that their policy is primarily focused on what is legally required, rather than taking a particular stance on AI. The company acknowledges that AI is a constantly evolving technology and they are working on integrating it into their existing review policies that reflect current copyright laws and policies. They also mentioned that they will refund the app submission fee in cases where this policy is the deciding factor.","The company acknowledges that AI is a constantly evolving technology and they are working on integrating it into their existing review policies that reflect current copyright laws and policies.

124,Celestial AI Secures $100M to Amplify Growth of Photonic Fabric Technology Platform,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/04/celestial-ai-secures-100m-to-amplify-growth-of-photonic-fabric-technology-platform/,"Celestial AI, a developer of optical interconnect technology, has successfully raised $100 million in a series B funding round for its Photonic Fabric platform. The investment was led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies (KDT), and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund, with participation from several other companies including Samsung Catalyst, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, and M Ventures. Celestial AI’s Photonic Fabric platform offers a significant advancement in optical connectivity performance, surpassing existing technologies. The company has raised a total of $165 million from seed funding to series B. 
The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as ChatGPT and recommendation engines, requires increased memory capacity and bandwidth. However, cloud service providers and large data centers face challenges due to the limitation of electrical interconnect, such as restricted bandwidth, high latency, and high power consumption. To address these challenges, Celestial AI has developed Photonic Fabric in collaboration with hyper scalers, AI computing, and memory providers. The optical interconnect is designed for scalable data center memory and enables accelerated computing.
The CEO of Celestial AI, Dave Lazovsky, explained that memory capacity, bandwidth, and data movement are key challenges for large language models (LLMs) and recommendation engine workloads. Photonic Fabric allows photonics to be integrated directly into the silicon die, enabling data to be delivered at any point on the die to the point of computing. The platform offers a significantly increased bandwidth with nanosecond latencies, allowing for fully photonic compute-to-compute and compute-to-memory links. The recent funding round has also attracted the attention of Broadcom, which is collaborating with Celestial AI on the development of Photonic Fabric prototypes.
Lazovsky further stated that as the volume of data being transferred within data centers increases, data rates must also rise. Electrical interconnects encounter issues such as signal fidelity loss and limited bandwidth, which restrict overall system throughput. Photonic Fabric’s low latency data transmission overcomes these limitations and allows for the connection and disaggregation of a higher number of servers. This low latency also enables latency-sensitive applications to utilize remote memory, a possibility that was previously unattainable.
Photonic Fabric aims to simplify enterprise computation for LLMs, deep learning recommendation models, and other AI models that require large memory capacity. By increasing the addressable memory capacity of each processor and providing fast chip-to-chip links, Photonic Fabric reduces the number of processors needed and increases throughput while reducing costs. The funding raised in this round will be used to accelerate the commercialization of Photonic Fabric by expanding Celestial AI’s teams.","The recent funding round has also attracted the attention of Broadcom, which is collaborating with Celestial AI on the development of Photonic Fabric prototypes.

127,The Government’s Opportunity to Empower Asia’s Citizens through Generative AI,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/03/the-governments-opportunity-to-empower-asias-citizens-through-generative-ai/,"In Taiwan, around 30,000 students per month are utilizing a new solution designed to help the country achieve its goal of becoming bilingual in Chinese and English by 2030. The aim is to enhance students’ English skills quickly, enabling them to compete with other countries. Howard Hao-Jan Chen, an English professor at National Taiwan Normal University, expressed the desire to assist students in becoming more proficient in English.
Initially, there were concerns about the use of generative AI in education. People worried that students may cheat or skip important steps in their learning process. However, Bartley Johns from Microsoft argues that the incorporation of calculators into math teaching has proven that learning methods can adapt successfully. He believes there are numerous positive opportunities for generative AI in education and hasn’t encountered anyone in Asia’s education sector who doubts its long-term use in universities and schools.
While generative AI is still in its early stages of development, regulation in Asia is still in its infancy. However, with the power of generative AI comes the responsibility to deploy it responsibly. It is crucial for the public sector to ensure privacy and data security and foster citizen trust.
Governments must determine the extent to which existing laws and regulations apply to the use of generative AI. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently addressed this issue in an AI national strategy white paper, emphasizing the importance of AI operating within legal boundaries. Similarly, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in New Zealand published helpful guidance on complying with privacy laws when using generative AI. New considerations might require the public sector to provide transparency about the AI models it relies on. Partnering with reputable cloud service providers enables governments to leverage existing privacy and security frameworks instead of starting from scratch.
Inclusion is another significant challenge for generative AI, as it aims to benefit everyone around the world. However, natural and conversational interactions can be difficult for those who are far from government service centres. To address this, governments need to extend mobile broadband connectivity, as disparities between urban and rural areas persist. Democratizing and expanding the use of personal devices is also essential.
Despite these challenges, Bartley Johns remains optimistic about the transformative potential of generative AI. As technology becomes more accessible and is placed in the hands of millions, and eventually billions of people, there is an opportunity for significant progress. Governments across Asia are recognizing this potential and expressing their interest in leveraging generative AI to drive advancement. According to Johns, “The underlying technologies are here today.”

128,There Is No Need to Fear Generative AI Despite Our Current Lack of Trust,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/03/there-is-no-need-to-fear-generative-ai-despite-our-current-lack-of-trust/,"While there has been a lot of buzz around the release of ChatGPT and the potential impact of generative AI, there are also concerns about its limitations. From an IT and software development perspective, the question arises: can enterprises trust this technology to handle critical and creative tasks? The answer, for now, seems to be not very much. Generative AI is plagued with inaccuracies, reliability issues, and lacks real-world context. Security vulnerabilities, such as the production and spread of misleading deepfake content, also raise justified concerns.
Despite these concerns, businesses should not be fearful but rather find a balance between caution and the potential of generative AI. It is not the first technology to face skepticism. Cloud computing, for example, initially raised alarms about data security and privacy. However, over time, with improved security measures and reliability, organizations embraced it. Open-source software also faced doubts about quality and security initially, but it eventually became widely adopted and supported.
That’s not to say that the worries about generative AI are invalid. There are legitimate concerns about fairness and bias. Generative AI models learn from existing data, which can perpetuate biases and unfair practices. Ensuring fairness and avoiding bias is a top ethical concern for CIOs and CTOs. Inaccuracies or “hallucinations” in AI-generated outputs are another area of concern. However, fears that generative AI will replace human talent seem overblown. Most IT professionals do not see job loss as a significant concern. In fact, many believe generative AI will increase the strategic importance of IT leaders.
Enterprises must approach generative AI with caution, while also recognizing its transformative potential in driving progress in the IT industry and beyond. The technology is already reshaping IT and software development and should not be stopped. Instead, businesses should address its limitations to fully harness its power and support IT and software development, improve efficiency, and build more advanced software solutions.","Enterprises must approach generative AI with caution, while also recognizing its transformative potential in driving progress in the IT industry and beyond.

129,AI Ethics and AI Law Find Promise in Enhancing Generative AI’s Domain Understanding through In-Context Learning and Data Engineering,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/03/ai-ethics-and-ai-law-find-promise-in-enhancing-generative-ais-domain-understanding-through-in-context-learning-and-data-engineering/,"Generative AI, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has become incredibly popular for its ability to engage in interactive dialogues and produce essays that appear to be written by humans. But there is a pressing question that arises when it comes to such AI models: should they be trained to be a jack-of-all-trades or specialized in specific domains? 
The current approach to generative AI is to develop models that are versatile and can talk about almost any topic. This means that while they may be well-versed in a wide range of subjects, they lack the depth of knowledge necessary to engage in in-depth discussions in specialized domains like medicine or law. 
This generalization of generative AI has led to some issues. For instance, there have been cases of attorneys relying on ChatGPT for legal research and presenting fabricated legal precedents in court, which resulted in severe consequences. Additionally, there have been instances of medical professionals relying on generic generative AI for medical advice, leading to potential misinformation.
The challenge lies in the fact that generative AI is usually trained on a vast amount of internet content, making it a jack-of-all-trades, but an expert in none. The aim is to cover a broad sense of natural language use. However, this comes with risks, as AI can produce outputs with errors, biases, falsehoods, and even hallucinations.
To address this conundrum, there is a growing focus on developing generative AI that is more specialized and domain-specific. This would involve training models on data from specific fields, allowing them to provide more accurate and reliable information in those domains.
There are also important ethical considerations at play. Efforts are underway to incorporate ethical AI principles in the development and deployment of AI applications, ensuring that AI is used for the greater good and not to the detriment of society. Proposed AI laws, such as the U.S. White House’s AI Bill of Rights, aim to safeguard human rights in an age of AI.","The challenge lies in the fact that generative AI is usually trained on a vast amount of internet content, making it a jack-of-all-trades, but an expert in none.

131,AI Is Not a Cure-All Solution for Software Development,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/03/ai-is-not-a-cure-all-solution-for-software-development/,"So, there’s been quite a buzz lately about the potential of AI to make developers 2x, 3x, or even 5x more efficient. Impressive, right? Well, hold on to your hats because one report is actually predicting a jaw-dropping tenfold increase in developer productivity by 2030. Can you believe it?
But here’s the twist, my friends. The engineering community, for the most part, can’t seem to come to a consensus on how to measure engineering productivity. Some have even gone as far as dismissing the whole idea, arguing that most metrics just don’t cut it. So, the claims about AI improving productivity that we hear today are mainly based on surveys and anecdotes, not solid numbers.
Now, this raises an important question: how can we make judgments about AI without first agreeing on how to measure productivity? I mean, if there’s one thing we learned from the whole remote work experiment, it’s that we stumbled and fumbled because we didn’t have enough data to guide our decisions. We were bouncing back and forth between office, remote, and hybrid setups based on gut feelings, not hard evidence. And guess what? We risk doing the same thing with AI if we don’t get our act together.
But hold on a minute, folks. I can hear some of you thinking, “Laura, what about the risks? What about the quality and the potential for plagiarism?” Well, you’re spot on with your concerns. Some companies are understandably playing it safe, adopting a wait-and-see approach. They want to avoid any unforeseen consequences and make sure the benefits outweigh the risks.
Yet, my dear tech-enabled businesses, the risk of falling behind in the AI race is existential. AI is like a rocket fuel for companies, revolutionizing both the “what” and the “how” of their operations. Those who invest in AI now can have their cake and eat it too. Not only can they bring AI-powered products to market, but they can also do it faster and cheaper. It’s a win-win situation, folks.
Many companies have been fixated on the “what” aspect of AI. What can it do for us? What products can we develop? But here’s the kicker: AI might just be the key to supercharging the “how,” creating engineering teams that are 10x or even 100x more effective. So, companies that crack the code and optimize AI tools in the most efficient and impactful way will have a massive head start. And trust me, the risk of doing nothing in this high-speed world we live in is just too darn high.
But before we get carried away, we need to understand the trade-offs, my friends. Remember the saying, “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”? Well, the same goes for AI. It’s a powerful tool, no doubt about it. Developers are singing its praises, saying it improves their coding language skills and takes care of repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate code. In fact, an experiment by Codecov showed that ChatGPT performs remarkably well when it comes to writing simple tests and straightforward code paths.
So, there you have it, folks. AI coding tools hold the promise of turbocharging developer productivity. But until we figure out how to measure that productivity effectively, we’re still in the dark. Let’s learn from our past mistakes and gather the data we need to make informed decisions about the impact of AI. And hey, who knows? Maybe we’ll witness that tenfold increase in productivity by 2030 after all. Stay tuned!

It seems we’ve finally arrived at the future that sci-fi fans have been predicting for decades as the Department of Defense in the US recently dared to trust the controls of an X-62A Variable Stability In-Flight Simulator Test Aircraft (catchy, ey?) to artificial intelligence in no less than 12 different tests. 
These groundbreaking tests were spread across a fortnight at the Edwards Air Force Base in sunny California, and gathered talents from heavyweight organisations including the U.S. Air Force Test Center, the Air Force Research Laboratory and the rather intriguingly named Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – a.k.a. DARPA.
The Air Force Research Lab’s Autonomous Air Combat Operations division, let’s call them AACO for short, utilised AI-driven autonomy agents to pilot the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School’s X-62A VISTA for advanced fighter manoeuvres. They engaged in beyond-visual-range combat against simulated opponents. 
DARPA’s ACE team, meanwhile, was all about the hands-on approach with AI agents performing within-visual-range manoeuvring, also known as dogfighting, against AI opponents. Think of it as a high-stakes game of Simon Says, played at breakneck speeds. 
Impressively, the AI agents played nicely, managing to execute autonomous tactical manoeuvring while respecting real-world airspace boundaries and optimising aircraft performance. Turns out machines can stick to the rules just as well as, if not better than, humans.
It appears the future might be upon us, folks! The whole venture was built upon the X-62A VISTA upgrade, which lets the X-62 mimic flight characteristics of fixed-wing vehicles such as the MQ-20 or, in this case, the iconic F-16.","DARPA’s ACE team, meanwhile, was all about the hands-on approach with AI agents performing within-visual-range manoeuvring, also known as dogfighting, against AI opponents.

133,Open Letter from European VCs and Tech Firms Calls for Caution in Draft EU AI Regulations,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/03/open-letter-from-european-vcs-and-tech-firms-calls-for-caution-in-draft-eu-ai-regulations/,"A group of major tech founders, CEOs, venture capitalists, and industry giants across Europe have written an open letter to the EU Commission expressing their concerns about potential laws that could stifle innovation in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The letter warns that Europe could miss out on the generative AI revolution if strict regulations are passed.
The letter, signed by executives from 150 businesses including Siemens and Airbus, highlights the risks of tight regulation, arguing that such rules could threaten the competitiveness of European companies in the AI industry. The signatories also believe that the proposed laws fail to adequately address the potential challenges posed by AI.
The letter states that AI offers Europe the opportunity to rejoin the technological avant-garde, but warns that the current regulatory proposals could tip over into stifling innovation. It calls for a regulatory body, composed of industry experts, to monitor the implementation of new laws and take into account advances in technology.
Critics argue that the EU’s draft proposals, known as the Artificial Intelligence Act, could make Europe the toughest jurisdiction in the world for operating AI platforms. These demands for regulation have increased since OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot was launched, leading to fears about privacy issues and other problems associated with generative AI. Italy, for example, has already banned the use of ChatGPT.
However, the signatories of the open letter, which include Renault and Heineken, argue that the proposed laws could heavily regulate foundational AI models regardless of their use cases. They claim that compliance costs and liability risks could be disproportionate, leading to companies and investors leaving the EU to take advantage of new AI innovations. This would create a significant productivity gap between Europe and the US in the AI field.
The signatories believe that regulators in Brussels should focus on creating laws based on rigid compliance rather than broad principles in a risk-based approach. They argue that this approach would allow Europe to stay at the forefront of the new AI era.
Dragoș Tudorache, an MEP involved in drafting the AI laws, criticized the open letter, claiming that a few aggressive companies were lobbying larger companies. However, the letter’s spokesperson, Jeannette zu Fürstenberg of La Famiglia, stated that the AI Act, in its current form, would have catastrophic consequences for European competitiveness.
The AI revolution is set to significantly shape the future of every continent, and Europe’s lack of technological leadership has been a topic of discussion for some time. The signatories argue that now is the time to take action and prevent potential consequences. They believe that Europe cannot afford to stay on the sidelines as AI becomes increasingly influential in various aspects of life and culture.
The open letter calls for a proportionate and forward-looking legislation that will protect European society while contributing to European competitiveness. The signatories stress the joint responsibility of European decision-makers to create a strong, innovative, and prosperous Europe.","The signatories also believe that the proposed laws fail to adequately address the potential challenges posed by AI.

136,Creative Ways to Utilize Excess Productivity,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/02/creative-ways-to-utilize-excess-productivity/,"In a recent study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, it was found that generative AI, such as ChatGPT, can increase workforce productivity by an average of 14%. Some companies are even reporting productivity boosts of up to 400% thanks to the implementation of AI technology. McKinsey estimates that generative AI has the potential to add up to $4.4 trillion worth of output annually. As a C-level manager or board director, this should definitely catch your attention.
But how can your company take advantage of this productivity boost without undergoing a lengthy and expensive investment? Well, the first thing to recognize is that AI is already displacing human jobs. According to research from Goldman Sachs, two out of every three American occupations are at risk of automation. Furthermore, worldwide, around 300 million jobs could potentially be replaced by automation. This isn’t a far-off future scenario—it’s already happening. In May 2023 alone, 3,900 jobs were eliminated due to AI according to a Challenger job report. IBM froze hiring for 7,800 jobs during the same period, as it believed they could be replaced in the coming years. Even British Telecom announced plans to replace more than 10% of its workforce with AI before 2030. 
So, where can you expect to see immediate disruption in your organization? There are four key areas in most large companies where generative AI can make a significant impact: customer operations, sales and marketing, software development, and research and development.
Firstly, generative AI can greatly increase productivity in customer care by as much as 45%. AI technology is capable of understanding customer intent and sentiment, providing personnel with the information they need to quickly resolve issues. Additionally, chatbots powered by generative AI can handle low-level customer service demands more efficiently than ever before.
Secondly, in sales and marketing, generative AI can analyze prospect behavior and help optimize strategic approaches. It can also create customized content such as emails, social media posts, advertising artwork, and product descriptions, allowing even small marketing and sales teams to personalize their efforts. Major companies like Microsoft and Salesforce have already introduced generative AI solutions in their sales departments.
Thirdly, when it comes to software development, 88% of coders report increased productivity when using generative AI. AI can perform repetitive tasks like inserting boilerplate code snippets, review human-generated code for bugs and security flaws, and even create software documentation.
Lastly, the potential applications of generative AI in research and development are vast. Whether it’s drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry, information analysis in various research fields, or industrial design in manufacturing, generative AI is a true game changer.
Now, how can you ensure your organization can benefit from generative AI? Firstly, don’t wait. Assume that your competitors are already using AI technology and get on board before you fall behind. Secondly, while generative AI can be incredibly efficient, it’s important to maintain human supervision to ensure quality standards and brand image are upheld. A human review is necessary to avoid bias, ethical issues, and other problems that only humans can understand at this point.
Thirdly, engage with your team. The productivity boost provided by AI may lead you to consider downsizing or reducing new hires. However, it’s crucial to communicate with your team and support them through this change. Some roles may be eliminated, while others will expand or remain unaffected. Make sure your team understands their roles and provide retraining and change management support.
Lastly, leadership from the top is vital. The CEO, senior executive team, and board of directors need to lead the organization’s AI revolution. They don’t have to be AI experts themselves, but they need to champion its use and ensure its implementation throughout the organization.","AI technology is capable of understanding customer intent and sentiment, providing personnel with the information they need to quickly resolve issues.

140,Breaking through the ChatGPT Hype: Empowering Businesses with Practical AI,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/02/breaking-through-the-chatgpt-hype-empowering-businesses-with-practical-ai/,"Title: Embracing the Generative AI Revolution: Lessons from the Big Data Era
Subtitle: Will AI deliver sustainable business outcomes or remain a sea of noise?
In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, top executives are set to gather in San Francisco on July 11-12 to explore the potential of generative AI and its impact on business. Although new products like ChatGPT have captured public attention, the question remains: what are the money-making applications of this emerging technology? Is generative AI destined to become a paradigm shift or simply another fleeting trend?
To chart the future of AI, it is worth looking back at the Big Data era, which spanned from 2003 to 2020. During this time, the internet revolutionized industries, generated immense web traffic, and fueled the growth of corporate empires. The rise of online actions produced valuable log files, which allowed businesses to gain insights into user behaviors and optimize their strategies. However, the true value of this data had to be unlocked through analysis and optimization, as it was scattered across various ecosystems.
Google serves as a prime example of how data can transform a company into a trillion-dollar empire. By leveraging data to enhance search results and later introducing monetization tools like Adwords, Google not only improved its core product but also expanded its offerings to include maps, collaborative documents, and cloud-based storage. Countless other companies, such as IBM and Snowflake, have likewise prospered by helping organizations effectively capture, manage, and optimize their data. The initial confusion surrounding big data ultimately yielded tremendous financial returns.
Now, the focus has shifted to generative AI, which harnesses the massive volumes of text produced by internet users in natural languages like English or Chinese. Thanks to the advent of big data, the storage and analysis of this textual data have become more accessible. Researchers have developed software capable of reading and writing based on this vast corpus of text. With ChatGPT’s arrival in late 2022, which left people wondering whether machines had come alive, the AI field is experiencing a momentous milestone.
However, the hype levels surrounding AI are reminiscent of the big data era, and the industry must now address how AI can deliver sustainable business outcomes. To accomplish this, AI platforms must incorporate three essential elements: generative AI models, user interfaces, and business applications, and a system to ensure trust in these models. Just as Google united these components during the Big Data era, the same must be done for AI to create what the author dubs “Workable AI.”
Generative AI models pose unique challenges due to their unpredictable behavior and the absence of conventional bug-fixing methods. These models, composed of complex equations that interact in ways beyond human comprehension, require continual teaching and feedback for improvement. Ensuring data quality and algorithm performance is crucial to prevent significant errors that may alienate users in high-stakes environments.
Building trust in AI involves governance, transparency, and explainability enforced through regulations. Industry leaders have taken commendable steps in setting guidelines, but further adoption of regulation is encouraged. Additionally, requiring AI-generated media to be clearly labeled as such when used in commercial or political contexts, akin to nutrition labels or movie ratings, will empower consumers to make informed choices.
Furthermore, the potential applications of generative AI are vast and diverse. From marketing collateral to music creation to medicine development, hundreds of companies have already emerged to capitalize on the technology. ChatGPT alone has shown improvements in coding efficiency. By experimenting and innovating, breakthrough companies will discover AI applications that provide a step-change in user experience and business performance, ultimately harnessing the technology’s full potential.
Despite the inevitable noise and skepticism surrounding AI, similar to the big data era, a focus on the principles of Workable AI promises transformative platforms and technologies that deliver substantial value. It may take time and iterations, but with a concerted effort in developing trustworthy AI models and killer apps powered by solid underlying models, this emerging field holds immense potential.
Florian Douetteau, CEO of Dataiku, emphasizes the need for collaboration and knowledge-sharing in the data community to drive innovation in this fast-evolving landscape. To stay up-to-date with the latest data-related insights and best practices, readers are encouraged to join the DataDecisionMakers community.
As the generative AI revolution unfolds, businesses and leaders will need to navigate the challenges and opportunities that arise. By drawing lessons from the Big Data era and embracing the principles of Workable AI, this emerging field has the potential to revolutionize industries, improve user experiences, and drive sustainable business outcomes.","However, the hype levels surrounding AI are reminiscent of the big data era, and the industry must now address how AI can deliver sustainable business outcomes.

141,Humans may be more likely to believe disinformation generated by AI,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/07/02/humans-may-be-more-likely-to-believe-disinformation-generated-by-ai/,"Humans could have a higher tendency to believe disinformation produced by AI
In a recent study conducted by Giovanni Spitale, a researcher at the University of Zurich, it has been found that AI-generated disinformation is not only cheaper and faster but also more effective. Spitale expressed concerns about this growing problem, stating that if the study were repeated with the latest large language model from OpenAI, GPT-4, the difference in credibility between AI-generated and human-written disinformation would be even more pronounced.
To test the susceptibility of individuals to different types of text, the researchers focused on common disinformation topics such as climate change and COVID-19. They asked OpenAI’s GPT-3 to generate 10 true tweets and 10 false ones, while also collecting a random sample of both true and false tweets from Twitter. Subsequently, 697 participants were recruited to complete an online quiz judging the accuracy and source of the tweets.
Surprisingly, the study found that participants were 3% less likely to believe false tweets written by humans compared to those generated by AI. The researchers are unsure of the exact reasons behind this phenomenon, but Spitale suggests that GPT-3’s ordering of information, which tends to be more structured yet condensed compared to human-written text, might play a role.
The generative AI boom has made powerful AI tools accessible to everyone, including bad actors. Models like GPT-3 have the ability to generate convincing but incorrect texts, which can be used to quickly and cheaply create false narratives for conspiracy theorists and disinformation campaigns. Unfortunately, AI text-detection tools that can help combat this problem are still in their early stages of development and are not entirely accurate.
OpenAI, the organization behind GPT-3, is aware of the potential weaponization of its AI tools for large-scale disinformation campaigns. Although it strictly prohibits such misuse, it released a report in January acknowledging the difficulty of completely preventing the use of large language models for generating disinformation. When approached for comments, OpenAI did not respond immediately.","Humans could have a higher tendency to believe disinformation produced by AI

169,AI Predicts and Prevents Water Pollution in England,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/06/16/ai-predicts-and-prevents-water-pollution-in-england/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is being harnessed in southwest England to predict and prevent water pollution, in a groundbreaking project aimed at improving water quality. The pilot initiative, taking place in Devon, focuses on the seaside resort of Combe Martin, with the goal of creating a safer environment for swimming.
The project utilizes a network of sensors strategically placed in rivers and fields to gather real-time data on local river conditions, rainfall, and soil quality. This information is then combined with satellite imagery of the surrounding land, enabling AI to predict the vulnerability of the river system to pollution, particularly from sources like agricultural runoff.
Computer systems company CGI, in collaboration with mapping experts Ordnance Survey, is leading the AI project. During initial test runs, the AI system achieved an impressive accuracy rate of over 90% in predicting pollution events. The trial is taking place within the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a protected area spanning 55 square miles, encompassing diverse natural habitats, farmland, and small towns.
CGI’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Mattie Yeta, explained that the AI system is trained using historical data, geographic information, and sensor datasets. By analyzing this information, the system develops predictive mechanisms to identify and forecast pollution incidents, enabling stakeholders to take proactive measures.
Combe Martin has long faced concerns regarding bathing water quality. Despite receiving a “good” rating from the Environment Agency last year, it is often impacted by pollution during more typical years, such as 2018 and 2019 when it received a “poor” rating, resulting in swimming advisories. The main contributor to the pollution is the River Umber, which carries discharges from both a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff.
The project aims to combat pollution by gathering a significant amount of real-time data. Floating water sensors installed in the river constantly monitor key indicators of water health, including acidity, ammonia levels, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. These sensors transmit data through mobile and Wi-Fi networks. Approximately 50 connected sensors, comprising water, soil, and rain gauges, are deployed throughout the catchment area.
Ordnance Survey plays a crucial role in integrating the sensor data with location-specific information and satellite imagery. By training the AI model using various data sets, including rainfall events, pollution sources can be identified. For instance, if the AI detects dry soil conditions with heavy rainfall forecasts, it may advise farmers to postpone applying fertilizers to prevent runoff into the waterways.
However, preventing sewage discharge during heavy rainfall remains a complex challenge, as it requires the water treatment plants to have the capacity to prevent releases. While the AI system can anticipate such events after heavy rainfall, it does not guarantee the ability to prevent discharge if the water company lacks the necessary infrastructure.
The project’s first phase involved a desk-based model using historical data, with CGI reporting an impressive 91.5% accuracy in predicting pollution events. The AI model is now being tested in real-world conditions, and CGI aims to expand the project beyond North Devon and implement it in other parts of the UK.
The potential benefits of this AI-powered approach to water pollution prevention extend far beyond Combe Martin, as it presents an innovative solution for preserving water quality across various regions. By proactively identifying pollution risks and implementing preventive measures, this project represents a significant step towards a cleaner and healthier aquatic environment.

While financial details remain undisclosed, Google has acknowledged the principle of payment and initiated discussions on the matter.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also held talks with News Corp and The New York Times regarding the use of their content in AI models. OpenAI has acknowledged discussions with publishers and publishing associations worldwide on potential collaborations.
Publishing leaders note the difficulty of developing a financial model for using news content to train AI, as tech companies launched these products without consulting the news industry. They express pessimism about retroactively seeking compensation and emphasize the lack of transparency and communication during the product launches.
Media analyst Claire Enders describes the current talks as complicated, highlighting the unlikelihood of a single commercial arrangement for all media groups, as each organization approaches the issue differently. A unified approach could prove counterproductive.
Enders further emphasizes the importance of ensuring chatbots are not primarily trained on text containing misogyny and racism, as this would undermine their credibility as tools.
Tech companies building AI stress the utility of AI in driving efficiency within newsrooms and enhancing journalism. They are willing to invest millions to maintain strong relationships with the industry.
Microsoft’s Vice-Chair Brad Smith envisions working with publishers to explore how AI can generate more revenue.
Adobe’s CEO Shantanu Narayen has recently met with Disney, Sky, and the UK’s Daily Telegraph to discuss developing custom AI models for generating images. Adobe’s model incorporates images from its own stock library, as well as openly licensed and public domain content.
Axel Springer’s Döpfner remains optimistic about reaching agreements, citing the industry’s and policymakers’ increased awareness of the challenges posed by AI compared to previous waves of technological disruption.
AI companies recognize the impending regulation and fear its impact. They believe that finding a solution for a healthy ecosystem is in the interest of all parties involved. Without incentives to create intellectual property, AI may become artificial stupidity.

173,AI Already Causing Unintended Harm: What Happens When It Falls into the Wrong Hands?,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/06/16/ai-already-causing-unintended-harm-what-happens-when-it-falls-into-the-wrong-hands/,"A researcher granted access to potent artificial intelligence (AI) software developed by Meta, Facebook’s parent company, leaked it to the public, raising concerns about the potential consequences. David Evan Harris, an adviser on AI ethics and former Meta researcher, expresses fear over the implications if these powerful tools are acquired by malicious actors.
Meta, positioning itself as a dominant AI platform, could shape the direction of AI at a fundamental level if it secures a central position in the AI ecosystem. Similar to Google’s control over the open-source Android operating system, Meta’s influence would extend to individual user experiences and limitations on other companies. This could lead to a highly profitable period for Meta in the AI space.
While Google’s Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT have safeguards in place, Meta’s semi-open source Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) and its descendant LLMs can be accessed and utilized by anyone without safety systems. This freedom of access raises concerns about the misuse of AI by unscrupulous political consultancies or intelligence agencies like Vladimir Putin’s GRU.
Harris emphasizes the potential for AI tools, such as LLaMA, falling into the wrong hands for disruptive purposes. They could be used to create convincing fake content, amplify incendiary content, or generate deepfake videos of political candidates. The battlegrounds for such influence operations would likely be Meta’s own platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.
Moreover, the author reflects on the unintended consequences of AI systems at scale, where even well-intentioned implementations have facilitated discrimination and caused harm. The risks of misalignment increase exponentially when AI is deliberately and maliciously abused.
Harris highlights the need for critical regulations and controls on AI technologies, including stronger restrictions on access to potentially dangerous AI tools. Trust and safety/integrity teams in both larger and smaller platforms require time to catch up with the implications of LLMs, deploying measures such as watermarking to identify AI-generated content and digital signatures to verify the authenticity of human-produced content.
Calls are made for new international governance bodies specific to AI, akin to those governing nuclear security, to address the race to the bottom on AI safety. Although the EU is ahead of the US in this regard, the implementation of regulations may be delayed until 2025 or later. Until new laws and governing bodies are established, tech CEOs must exercise forbearance to prevent the most powerful and dangerous AI tools from falling into the wrong hands, while lawmakers are urged to act promptly.
David Evan Harris, a chancellor’s public scholar at UC Berkeley and senior adviser for AI ethics, raises these concerns as the rapid acceleration of AI technologies demands immediate attention to prevent potential harm.","David Evan Harris, a chancellor’s public scholar at UC Berkeley and senior adviser for AI ethics, raises these concerns as the rapid acceleration of AI technologies demands immediate attention to prevent potential harm.

174,Some workers already replaced by artificial intelligence systems,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/06/16/some-workers-already-replaced-by-artificial-intelligence-systems/,"Workers in various industries are beginning to experience the displacement of their jobs by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The introduction of AI into workplaces has raised concerns about job security and the future of employment.
Dean Meadowcroft, a former copywriter in a small marketing department, found himself replaced by an AI system in his company. Initially, the AI was intended to work alongside human copywriters to streamline the content creation process. However, Mr. Meadowcroft was unimpressed with the AI’s work, as it made everyone’s writing sound generic and indistinguishable. Human staff still had to check the content to ensure it was not plagiarized. Despite these shortcomings, the AI could generate content in a fraction of the time it took a human copywriter. After approximately four months, Mr. Meadowcroft and his team were laid off, leaving him convinced that the AI had replaced them.
Late last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an AI system capable of providing human-like responses and generating various types of content rapidly. This development, along with other tech giants such as Google launching their own AI systems like Bard, has sparked discussions about the jobs that might be at risk due to AI advancements. Goldman Sachs’ report earlier this year estimated that AI could potentially replace around 300 million full-time jobs. Administrative and legal professions were identified as particularly vulnerable, with 46% of tasks in these fields susceptible to automation. In contrast, construction and maintenance jobs had lower automation risks, at 6% and 4% respectively.
While the introduction of AI has the potential to lead to job losses, it can also enhance productivity, stimulate growth, and create new employment opportunities. IKEA, for instance, has retrained thousands of call centre workers as design advisers, with an AI named Billie now handling 47% of customer calls. Despite IKEA’s assurance that there have been no job losses resulting from AI implementation, many individuals remain concerned about the impact on their livelihoods.
A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) revealed that a third of workers worldwide fear being replaced by AI, with frontline staff displaying more anxiety than managers. This discrepancy is attributed to a lack of familiarity with AI technology among frontline employees. However, anxiety surrounding the potential consequences of AI implementation is not unfounded.
Alejandro Graue, a voiceover artist, experienced firsthand the consequences of AI in his profession. After three months of voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel, he discovered that his work was replaced by an AI-generated voiceover without his knowledge. The client had experimented with AI due to its cost-effectiveness and speed. Although the AI-generated voiceover received negative feedback from viewers and was eventually taken down, Mr. Graue worries about the future of voiceover artists like himself. He contemplates the need to adapt and seeks alternative job opportunities that may be less susceptible to AI replacement.
As AI continues to advance, it is becoming increasingly common for workers to collaborate with AI systems rather than being entirely replaced by them. Dean Meadowcroft, for example, now works for an employee assistance provider where he incorporates AI into his job of providing wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. He believes that the future of AI lies in its ability to provide quick access to human-led content, rather than eliminating the human element entirely.
The impact of AI on the workforce is a topic of ongoing discussion, and the experiences of workers interacting with AI systems are essential in understanding the changes AI brings to different industries. The full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue can be viewed on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.","Initially, the AI was intended to work alongside human copywriters to streamline the content creation process.

175,Prof Yann LeCun: AI Won’t Destroy Jobs Forever,https://ainewstoday.co.uk/2023/06/16/prof-yann-lecun-ai-wont-destroy-jobs-forever/,"Prof Yann LeCun, a renowned AI expert and one of the pioneers in the field, has dismissed fears that artificial intelligence (AI) poses a threat to humanity as “preposterously ridiculous.” LeCun, often referred to as one of the “godfathers of AI,” believes that while computers may eventually surpass human intelligence, the idea that AI will take over the world or permanently eliminate jobs is unfounded.
Speaking at an event for invited press, LeCun, who currently serves as the chief AI scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, emphasized the importance of understanding that the development of AI is a gradual process. He stated that if AI is deemed unsafe, it simply won’t be built. Comparing the concerns about AI to the early days of turbo-jet safety, he highlighted how turbo jets eventually became reliable and safe, asserting that the same will happen with AI.
LeCun’s confidence in the future of AI is grounded in the ongoing research and advancements in the field. While he acknowledges that AI will eventually surpass human intelligence, he believes that researchers are still missing essential concepts that will take years, if not decades, to develop.
Addressing concerns about the possibility of super-intelligent AI systems taking over the world, LeCun dismissed the notion as “preposterously ridiculous.” He pointed out that even if AI reaches the level of a rat’s brain, it will still operate within controlled environments, such as data centres, with an off switch. The notion that AI could pose an immediate and catastrophic threat is based on misconceptions.
Regarding the impact of AI on jobs, LeCun emphasized that while work will change, it will not lead to a permanent loss of employment for many people. He stated that predicting the most prominent jobs twenty years from now is challenging, as AI will create new opportunities, much like the internet and the printing press did in the past. He believes that intelligent computers will contribute to “a new renaissance for humanity.”
LeCun’s remarks come ahead of a vote on Europe’s AI Act, aimed at regulating artificial intelligence. While he is not against regulation, LeCun believes that each AI application should have its own rules and regulations, tailored to its specific context and purpose. He cited conversations with AI start-ups in Europe who have expressed concerns that the proposed legislation is too broad and restrictive.
As the field of AI continues to advance, discussions about its potential risks and impact on society are essential. LeCun’s perspective as one of the leading figures in the AI community provides valuable insights into the future of AI and its implications for humanity.
